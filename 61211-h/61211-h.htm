<h2 class="nobreak">FOREWORD</h2></div>


<p>These tales are at last put upon paper, after having
served the demands of a generation of little folk&mdash;now
grown tall&mdash;for stories of &#8220;when papa was
a boy.&#8221; All the tales are founded upon facts, and
many are incidents and experiences reproduced as
faithfully as memory paints the pictures.</p>

<p>The red men are gone; the great forest is no more;
railroads and cities and farms occupy the bottom of
the &#8220;Old Sea Bed.&#8221; But the same courage and hardihood
and clean living which marked the pioneers of
near a half century ago is still the hope of America.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />

<small>IN THE BED OF AN ANCIENT SEA</small></h2></div>


<p>Men of science who have made a study of the earth&#8217;s
surface, say that Lake Erie, from which flows Niagara
river northward into Lake Ontario, will, in a certain,
or uncertain, number of years, go dry, and what is now
a wide though shallow sheet of water become a plain,
through which may meander a slowly-flowing river.
The reason for this prediction is that Niagara Falls,
which have cut their way back from Lewiston through
a gorge some seven miles, and are still eating their way
through the limestone and the softer underlying shale
at the rate of more than two feet a year, will finally
accomplish their journey, and the great lake be reached
and drained.</p>

<p>A similar event seems really to have occurred in
the past history of the earth near the geographical
center of the state of Wisconsin. Draw a line through
the center of the map of this state, from north to south,
and then another from east to west, at a little more
than one-third of the way up from the southern boundary,
and at the intersection you will have the location
of the lower end of what appears to have been an ancient
lake, or inland sea.</p>

<p>The eastern boundary, evidently, was a range of
hills some forty miles to the east, along whose sides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
fifty years ago, were easily recognized traces of successive
diminishing shore lines, in rows of water-worn
pebbles and shells.</p>

<p>The southern boundary is marked by sandstone
bluffs, which bear the fantastic carving of waves.
Rising nearly perpendicular from the sands like the
front of some gigantic ramparts of a fortress, an hundred
or more feet, the upper portions are fashioned
into turrets, bastions, and domes, until at a distance
it is difficult to believe that one is not looking upon
some mighty work of man.</p>

<p>Here and there, many miles apart, huge granite
rocks rear their heads hundreds of feet above the plain&mdash;islands
of the old sea.</p>

<p>Of course caves abound in these water-worn bluffs,
and these were found, in the early days of settlement,
to be the homes and hiding places of bears, wolves,
panthers, and the even more dreaded &#8220;Indian-devil,&#8221;
or northern lynx. Not infrequently they were utilized
for temporary human habitation. Indeed, one of
these very caves became the last hiding place of Black
Hawk, the famous Indian chief, as he sought escape
from the white man after the failure of the war he had
waged, like his predecessor, Tecumseh, in hope of
uniting the various tribes against the crowding, appropriating
paleface.</p>

<p>Near the present city of Kilbourn, at what is known
as the Delles, the Wisconsin river breaks through the
rocky barrier and pours its foaming flood down a narrow
gorge that is only exceeded in size, and not at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
in wild beauty and grandeur, by the gorge and rapids
below Niagara. The falls have worn their way
through, but evidently, here was the Niagara of the
ancient sea.</p>

<p>The shallower part of the old sea was the eastern
portion, where in width of fifty miles or more, in the
time of which I write, there stretched a level waste
of sand. It was to this floor of the old sea that people
from the eastern states flocked by thousands, at the
time of the &#8220;hop boom,&#8221; when it was discovered that
this vine could be grown and would bear fairly good
crops upon these sands. The ground was easily worked,
and while the hop plant required two years to come
into bearing, the profit from the dried blossoms was
enormous, and the settlers saw great fortunes ahead.
Money was borrowed, possessions in many cases mortgaged,
fine houses erected, drying kilns built, hop
roots planted, and the slender tamarack poles upon
which the vines were to climb to the ripening sunlight,
were set into the ground. The country was settled.
The first immigrants harvested one crop at the
bonanza price. Then rumors came of an enormous
crop thrown upon the market from the fields of Washington
and Oregon, new lands of the Pacific coast. The
second season found the market overstocked, and prices
tumbled from sixty cents to eight and ten cents per
pound, which was less than would pay the expense of
picking. Hundreds of the settlers never harvested
their first crop. For years afterward one could travel
miles across the sand and see nothing but deserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
houses with abandoned farms growing up to stunted
pines.</p>

<p>Among those who had lost in the hop venture, was
the family of John Allen, in which were two boys,
Robert and Ed, lads of twelve and ten years. The
Allens, coming of the rugged Scotch-Irish stock, had
no thought of returning to their old home &#8220;back east&#8221;
defeated, but pushed further westward into the wilderness.
Coming to the river in the time of low water,
they easily crossed the broad bed of the &#8220;Ouis-kon-sin,&#8221;
or, as the modern spelling has it, the &#8220;Wisconsin&#8221;
river, and pushed on past the sandy plains west of
the river over into the western half of the old lake
bed. It was among the beautiful hardwood trees that
lined the banks of the golden-hued Ne-ce-dah, or Yellow
river, that they halted and said, &#8220;This shall be
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the city-bred boys the land was one of perpetual
wonder, and their sturdy bodies and enquiring minds
were actively employed. Of course there was much
work to do, fencing and clearing willow shrubs from
the land, making hay for the winter use of their stock,
but Mr. Allen was wise enough to give the boys a large
portion of time for their &#8220;education,&#8221; as he called their
excursions into the forest and along the river.</p>

<p>Coming home from one of these trips, the boys
were seen to be in a state of excitement, and almost
before they were near enough to be understood they
were shouting, &#8220;Neighbors, neighbors! Just around the
big bend.&#8221; It was a happy discovery for the Allens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
as the new-found neighbors proved to be a family
who had come, several years before, from Ohio, and
whose young son, Dauphin, was about the age of the
Allen boys. The name of the family was Thompson,
the wife, Ruth, being the only daughter of &#8220;Old John
Brown,&#8221; whose soul &#8220;goes marching on.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the years the Allens were neighbors to this
family, they came to learn much of the life and character
of that strange man who was hated as no other
man by the slaveholders of his time, and, probably,
was as little understood by those of the north who
apologized for him. To this humble home of their
only sister, in the wilderness, there came, as occasional
guests, one and another of the sons who remained
of the man who threw away his life at Harper&#8217;s Ferry,
that a people might be aroused to a knowledge of the
sin of human slavery. Ruth, they said, was the womanly
image of her father. She had an abundance of red
hair like his, had his features, and more, was like him
in spirit. With all the ardor of youthful hero-worship
the Allen boys bestowed homage upon John
Brown&#8217;s daughter, Ruth Thompson. If she was like
her father, he had been patient in trial, sweet of spirit
in affliction, tender in love for the unfortunate, and
utterly void of any desire of retaliation for injuries
received. The hair of the Allen boys is silvering, and
Ruth has long ago passed to her rest, yet they do not
forget an incident which reveals the Christ-like spirit
of the daughter of &#8220;Old John Brown&#8221;&mdash;and perhaps
of the father.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>It was upon the visit of John Brown, Jr., the son
who had charge of the Canadian end of the &#8220;underground
railway&#8221; over which so many of the slaves of
the South had found their way to freedom, that Mr.
Thompson and &#8220;Uncle Sam,&#8221; a younger brother, both
of whom were in the attack upon the arsenal at Harper&#8217;s
Ferry, and had lost other brothers in that raid,
were recalling the time when John, Jr., had been taken
by the &#8220;bushwhackers,&#8221; tied to the tail of a horse and
compelled to run at great speed for several miles, or be
dragged to death. John, Jr., was a heavy man, and
the fearful experience brought on a heart trouble from
which he suffered all the rest of his life. The men, as
they talked over those days of sorrow and trial, would
occasionally utter some stout words against their persecutors,
but quickly Ruth would break in, in her
gentle voice&mdash;&#8220;Boys, boys! Speak evil of none. &#8216;Vengeance
is mine, saith the Lord.&#8217; It may be those poor
men thought they were doing right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Never did the Allen boys hear one unkind word
from this daughter against the government, the individuals,
or the section that had imposed upon her
father an ignominious death.</p>

<p>Dauphin Thompson and the Allen boys became
great friends and inseparable companions, and in the
&#8220;education&#8221; of the latter the grandson of &#8220;Old John
Brown&#8221; not only joined, but was able to initiate them
into many of the mysteries of wood and stream. The
Allen boys had new breech-loading shotguns, but
Dauphin was the proud possessor of the carbine which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
his father had carried from Osawatomie to Harper&#8217;s
Ferry, and which had been fitted for small-shot cartridges.</p>

<p>To the north, from which the Yellow river flowed,
lay the vast, unbroken forests of pine; to the west
stretched many miles of swamp and low-lying prairie.
In the summer these prairies were covered with grass
often so high as to completely hide the tallest man
walking through. Game abounded. Deer were so unafraid
that frequently the boys would find them quietly
feeding among the cattle when they went at night
to bring home the milch cows. Bears, panthers, and
wild cats came at night to call, and left their &#8220;cards&#8221;
in great tracks on the sand along the river front of the
new home.</p>

<p>Here, in the bottom of the ancient sea, these boys
began lessons which made of two of them stalwart,
honored men, and which one of them had the good
fortune to supplement, at a later day, in college.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />

<small>CATCHING THE FAWN</small></h2></div>


<p>The first winter after the Allen family moved to
their new home on the Necedah river was unusually
severe and long. While in that section of Wisconsin
deep snows were not uncommon, this year they had
started in about the middle of October, and by Christmas
lay piled in great drifts, like small hills, in places,
while on the level even the top rail of the &#8220;stake-and-rider&#8221;
fence about the buildings was covered, and over
which the boys, Rob and Ed, hauled loads of hay in
their sleds. Between the house and stable there was
one huge drift, higher than either building, through
which the boys cut a tunnel large enough to drive
through with their team of steers and bob-sled.</p>

<p>Uncle Sam Thompson, who was wise in the ways of
weather, prophesied a spring flood that would sweep
away the fences and come up into the houses; and,
indeed, such a flood did occur a few years later, but
this year the winter held on so late into the spring, and
the snows melted away so slowly and gradually, that
the feared high water did not come.</p>

<p>The Allen boys were initiated into a new and delightful
experience in the latter days of March. Warm
days would be followed by freezing nights, which,
Uncle Sam declared, were ideal &#8220;sap&#8221; conditions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Hundreds of great maple trees lined the river, and
while they were not of the &#8220;rock,&#8221; or regular sugar
variety, but the &#8220;soft&#8221; maple, yet the sap held enough
of sweet to yield a fair amount of sugar.</p>

<p>To less sturdy youths the trudging through melting
snow and wading in icy water would have been accounted
anything but a pastime, but the Allen boys
and their chum, Dauphin Thompson, worked at the
sugar making with zeal and zest. Uncle Sam showed
them how to &#8220;tap&#8221; the trees. First, a hole would be
bored into the tree trunk with an inch augur, then a
V-shaped notch would be cut through the bark just
above it. Into the augur hole would be driven a
&#8220;spile,&#8221; or piece of grooved wood, down which the
sap from the V-shaped cut would run. At the foot of
the tree, under the spout, would be placed a wooden
trough, hollowed out from a block of the light linden,
or &#8220;basswood.&#8221;</p>

<p>To carry the sap home to the big kettles which were
kept constantly boiling, reducing the thin sap to syrup,
and finally &#8220;sugaring off&#8221; into the delectable sweet
cakes, a yoke of ash was made fitting over the shoulders,
with projecting ends. To these ends were attached
ropes which were fastened each to a large
bucket. These buckets the boys would fill with sap
from the trees, and from the farthest point, trudge
home a mile through water and melting snow. It was
no easy play, and aching backs and limbs severely
tested their courage, yet the boys felt amply repaid
for it all in the two hundred pounds of cakes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
delicious sweet they thus harvested during the two
weeks of the &#8220;run.&#8221;</p>

<p>By the time the sugar harvest was over, wild ducks
had begun to appear, and the lagoons and deep places
in the marshes were noisy at night and early morning
with their quacking. While most of the wild fowl
passed on to their summer home in the lake region of
Canada, some of the ducks built their nests and reared
their young in the marshes and along the rivers of that
section. Among these were the mallards, large, beautiful
birds.</p>

<p>The boys had frequently noticed a pair of these
ducks at Round Slough in the latter days of their sap
gathering, and had planned to hunt for the nest and
secure the eggs which they proposed to place for hatching
under a hen. Mrs. Thompson had told the boys
that she had known the mallards to be domesticated
when hatched away from the wild mother, but care
had to be taken to keep them confined at migrating-time
in the fall, else they would try to follow off their
wild cousins as they flew over.</p>

<p>Spring work pressed so heavily that the boys did
not get to visit Round Slough until in May, when one
bright day came with the coveted vacation. The slough
was back from the river perhaps a quarter of a mile.
It was several rods in diameter, of great depth, and
perfectly round. The banks were high and sloped
away from the hole, as well as toward the water. No
trees were growing near the edge, but the sides of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
rim were covered with &#8220;blue-joint&#8221; grass already waist
high.</p>

<p>The boys approached the slough cautiously. &#8220;There
they are,&#8221; whispered Dauphin. &#8220;But see what the old
ducks have.&#8221; For, sporting in the water, standing on
their heads, waving their funny, big feet in the air,
and chasing water bugs, were a dozen downy, yellow
ducklings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s drive them to land and catch them,&#8221; said
Ed.</p>

<p>So the boys dashed up to the water&#8217;s edge and began
to throw in sticks and to &#8220;shoo.&#8221; The father duck flew
away, but the mother kept with her babies and paddled
to the other side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll watch this side and keep up the fuss,&#8221; said
Rob, &#8220;and you boys can run around and catch them in
the grass. You see just where they went out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, there they are,&#8221; called Dauphin, &#8220;away over
on that side.&#8221; And sure enough, there were the mother
duck and her babies skirting the bank, in the water
again. Time and again the boys chased the little
family from the slough, only to lose sight of them entirely
&#8220;just where they went out.&#8221; The boys were
separated now on three sides of the slough, when suddenly
there was a great splash in the water and a doe
came swimming across, making, as the boy thought,
straight for Rob. A deer is no mean antagonist, and
Rob scrambled out of the way, while the animal went
crashing through the bushes.</p>

<p>Over where Dauphin had been there was a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
threshing about in the grass, and a boy&#8217;s voice shouting,
&#8220;Help! help! come quick.&#8221; Ed and Rob hurried
around the slough, and there was Dauphin trying to
hold down a young fawn which was making desperate
efforts to escape. But for the arrival of the other boys
it might have succeeded in tumbling Dauphin into the
deep water. The three boys easily handled the little
creature, but Rob&#8217;s hand bore the imprint of one of
its sharp hoofs for many a day.</p>

<p>&#8220;I almost stumbled over the old deer,&#8221; said Dauphin,
&#8220;and I never would have discovered this little
chap if I hadn&#8217;t fallen over him. However did they
manage to hide so well and keep so still while we were
running all about them?&#8221;</p>

<p>The fawn, which was probably two weeks old, was
&#8220;all legs,&#8221; as the Allen boys expressed it. The back
of his brown coat was flecked with spots of white,
while his under parts were pure white. Tying both
his front and hind legs with their handkerchiefs, the
boys took turns in carrying their new pet home, where
they soon succeeded in teaching it to drink milk.
When it was caught it could easily run about under
the kitchen table, but it throve and grew so rapidly
and became so boisterous in its manifestations of friendship,
that, in a few weeks, Mrs. Thompson declared
it had outgrown its place of household pet.</p>

<p>The boys built a pen of rails, and cut fresh grass
for it every day, and later in the season at the advice
of Mr. Thompson, added the twigs of the poplar or
aspen to its diet. They would cut down a young tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and stand it in the corner of the pen. When the fawn
had nibbled all the tender twigs from the lower limbs
he would rise upon his hind legs and walk about the
tree on two feet, browsing from the higher branches,
just as though that was the natural way for a deer to
get about, as indeed it was in a situation of that kind.</p>

<p>As the fall approached the young deer began to lose
his spotted coat of brown, and take on a winter suit of
grey. Little hard knobs could be felt on his head where
the &#8220;spikes,&#8221; or one-prong horns would appear the
following months. Like a rapidly developing boy he
began to take on &#8220;manish&#8221; ways, and to show an intention
of &#8220;seeing the world.&#8221; Although the boys increased
the height of his pen to ten rails, even that
would not hold him when the desire to roam came too
strongly upon him.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions, when the boys had missed
him from the pen, they came across him a quarter of
a mile away in the meadow, acting in a peculiar manner.
Long before they reached him they could hear
his angry snorts and could see the hair along the ridge
of his back sticking up like quills upon a porcupine.
The young deer was dancing around in a circle, face
toward the center, now advancing, now springing
quickly back, all the time his eyes fixed upon one
spot. Just as the boys were drawing near he gave a
spring into the air, and, bunching his four feet together,
came down like a bolt out of the sky. The
stroke was evidently effective, for on the ground was
the writhing threshing body of a huge black rattlesnake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the dreaded massasauger, with head severed
from the body as cleanly as if cut with a knife. The
sharp hoofs had done quick and sure execution.</p>

<p>Unable to keep the deer in confinement as he would
grow larger the boys disposed of him for a good sum
to a collector for an eastern city park.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE GREAT BLUE HERON</small></h2></div>


<p>&#8220;Dauph,&#8221; said Robert Allen one morning in early
spring, &#8220;I saw a pair of wood ducks over in Cut-off
Slough yesterday, and the drake had the handsomest
plumage I ever saw on a bird. He would make a fine
specimen for your collection.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dauphin was a &#8220;born naturalist,&#8221; as his father
called him, which meant that the lad had a sense of
the beauty and wonder of nature, and went about with
his eyes open. From the furred and feathered dwellers
of the wilderness into which the family had moved,
when Dauphin was a small child, he had secured and
mounted a collection of specimens that would have
graced the great college which it was his ambition
some day to attend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go over and have a look at him in the morning,
Rob,&#8221; eagerly responded Dauphin.</p>

<p>Rob agreed, but it was rather late in the afternoon
instead of early in the morning, as they had planned,
before the boys were ready for their trip.</p>

<p>Cut-off Slough had once been a part of the river. A
long bend, a mile around, had, in a time of unusual
high water, been cut off by the flood breaking over and
wearing a new channel through the narrow neck of
land, not more than fifty feet across. The hundred or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
more acres enclosed in the great bend had now become
an island, and the old bed of the river a deep lagoon,
or slough, as it was called, making an ideal home for
fish and wild fowl. The wearing of the new channel
of the river had formed a bar of sand across the mouth
of the lagoon, high and dry during the summer, but
now, in the spring rise, overflowed, so that the boys
waded knee deep in the cold water to gain its banks.</p>

<p>Great trees, oak, maple, linden, birch, and ash,
overhung the still water, and the western sun cast dark
shadows almost across its surface.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lucky for us it isn&#8217;t July,&#8221; said Dauphin, &#8220;or
we couldn&#8217;t stay in this place without face nets; the
mosquitoes would eat us alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me they are bad enough now,&#8221; replied
Rob, slapping at a dozen big fellows that had struck
his face. &#8220;Sh-sh! there is our beauty and his sober
wife. Over there by the stump with the white streaks,
and the limb sticking up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too far for these small shot,&#8221; whispered Dauphin;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to use large shot; spoils the plumage.
Let&#8217;s crawl closer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two boys crouched down, and on hands and
knees slowly crawled through the tall grass and reeds
to where a point of land jutting out into the water
would give them the advantage they sought. But
just as Dauphin was about the fire the shot that would
add another valuable specimen to his collection, something
occurred that drove all thoughts of ducks from
their mind. The &#8220;stump&#8221; lowered its &#8220;limb&#8221; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
had been sticking straight up, and out from its sides
spread two wings, fully eight feet from tip to tip.
As the &#8220;limb&#8221; bent over, the white streaks down the
&#8220;stump&#8221; stood out in regal plumes from the crest of
a magnificent bird.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Rob,&#8221; gasped Dauphin, &#8220;it must be the Great
Blue Heron. I have never seen one before, but Professor
Hodge&#8217;s son Clifton, at Carleton, sent me the
picture of one, and told me to keep my eyes open for
him. He says they are rare now, though they used to
be numerous, especially in the northern part of the
state, and the college has no specimen of the bird.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me get him for you,&#8221; said Rob. &#8220;The heavy
shot in my gun will do surer work than your fine shot.&#8221;
But before Rob could get aim, the great bird began
to move about in such a peculiar way that both boys
could only stare in wonder. Stepping out upon the
sandbar the heron crouched or squatted down, and
began to go around and around, backward and forward,
in a sort of hop and skip. Then the boys saw
coming down the sand from out the shadows the cause
of all this strange bowing and scraping by the big
bird. A second heron, not bright blue as the first, but
clad in more somber garments of bluish-grey, walked
solemnly toward her prospective lord and master.
Approaching each other, both birds stood perfectly
still&mdash;as motionless as statues, their long bills pointing
straight up, and each balancing upon one foot. They
stood this way for a full minute, as if in solemn contemplation,
and then both joined in the mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
gyrations. Approaching each other with wings out-stretched,
in the indescribably funny waltz step, they
would touch the tips of their bills and bow to the
ground two or three times. Then they would separate
and go waltzing past each other with the hop
and skip, back and forth, around and around, finally
to come and touch bills and go to bowing again.</p>

<p>The whole performance was so comical that the
boys rolled over in the grass shaking with merriment,
and Rob, unable to restrain his hilarity, gave a loud
&#8220;ha! ha!&#8221; At once there was a flap of wings and the
female bird went sailing over the tops of the trees.
The blue heron, he of the royal plumes, however, after
one upward spring, settled down and stood in dignified
stolidity, apparently gazing at the sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shoot! Rob, shoot!&#8221; cried Dauphin. &#8220;Get him
before he can get away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said Rob. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see he&#8217;s fast some
way? He&#8217;s wound some of that tough grass around
one of his legs. Let&#8217;s catch him alive. Think of the
money we can make taking him around showing him.
Or maybe we can sell him to the professor in your
college for a big sum. Surely a live bird will bring
more than a mere specimen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys threw down their guns and made a rush
in the direction of the great bird. But the ground
where the dancing party had been held was more
adapted to bird than human feet, and their progress
was slow as they sank half way to their knees in the
soft earth and water.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>&#8220;You stay on this side while I&#8217;ll go around behind,
and we&#8217;ll make a grab at him together. We can hold
him all right,&#8221; said Rob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Dauphin, &#8220;catch him around his wings,
and I&#8217;ll hold his legs.&#8221; And both boys made a rush.
The big bird made another unavailing attempt to rise,
then, awaiting the attack, drew back the long neck,
and with the white plumes standing straight out behind,
sent his bill like a sword-thrust straight at
Dauphin&#8217;s breast. There was a sound of the impact
of the blow, a moan from the boy, who sank crumpled
up to the ground, and, with another mighty lift of the
huge wings the Great Blue Heron was free.</p>

<p>Plunging through the rushes and mud, Rob reached
his chum, carried him up the bank, and opened his
thick hunting jacket and shirt. The long bill of the
bird had evidently broken a rib, but had not penetrated
the flesh. In a moment Dauphin opened his
eyes. &#8220;My! what was it? I can&#8217;t breathe. Who
would have thought that pesky bird could strike like
that?&#8221; And, indeed, Dauphin was fortunate to have
escaped with the discomfort of a broken rib, that
would be &#8220;as good as new&#8221; in a couple of weeks. The
strength and thickness of his buckskin jacket probably
saved his life, for less than a fortnight later a young
Indian of a nearby camp, struck upon the bare side by
the bill of a &#8220;sandhill&#8221; crane, a much smaller bird
than the Great Blue Heron, was pierced to the heart
and instantly killed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Rob, &#8220;we didn&#8217;t get any specimens,
but we did get to attend the heron&#8217;s ball.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Dauphin, &#8220;but I think the next time
I go will be when I am an <i>invited</i> guest.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>THE FOREST FIRE</small></h2></div>


<p>Those who were boys and girls in the Middle West
in the year 1871, will have a vivid remembrance of the
great comet that moved across the northern sky during
the month of August. It was so large and brilliant,
that before the sun had been altogether hidden in the
west, the fiery orb of this celestial stranger could
be seen glowing and as night came on the long tail
would appear spreading out in a fan of light half
way across the heavens. Mr. Allen was an educated
man, whose favorite study in his school days had been
astronomy, and although he had instructed his young
sons as to the facts concerning comets, their relation
to other heavenly bodies and to the earth, the rumor
which had found its way into this Wisconsin wilderness
home, that the world was to be destroyed by the
&#8220;fervent heat&#8221; of this flaming visitor, had its effect
upon the boys.</p>

<p>To the natural fear of the marvelous and unusual
in the sky, was added the alarming conditions
of a severe drouth, all over the county. Dauphin had
told the boys how a burning wad from his gun had
set fire to the dry peat in a marsh to the west, and the
&#8220;ground&#8221; had been burning there in great holes for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
more than a week. Before the close of July the river
had ceased to run, and water was only to be found
in the deep holes of its bed. The sky was brassy-looking
in the day, and at night the moon had the appearance
of blood. Then came weeks when a thick haze
hung over all the land, and the sickly, yellow-hued
sun could be looked upon with naked eyes. It seemed
as if all nature was disturbed, frightened, and awaiting
some impending calamity. The wild creatures of
the forest, birds and animals, became strangely numerous.
Deer were seen about the water holes in the
day time, and seemed scarcely frightened when approached.
Grey, black, and big, red fox-squirrels
swarmed in the trees and on the fences. The little
patch of sod corn the boys had planted on the &#8220;new
breaking&#8221; that spring was harvested in the milk by
the southward-moving emigrants of the forest.</p>

<p>A timber scout stopped over night at the hospitable
home of Mr. Thompson and told how the little,
lumber-manufacturing town of Peshtigo, up in the big
woods northwest, had been wiped out by fire, scores
of the inhabitants perishing before they could reach
the river, so sudden was the coming of the storm of
flame over the forest. Many others had been suffocated
with smoke or overcome by the fierce heat and
drowned even after they had reached the water. &#8220;The
big woods from Lake Superior to Green Bay are burning,&#8221;
said the traveler.</p>

<p>But what caused the more anxiety to the Allens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
was the rumor he had heard at Pete-en-well Ferry that
Chicago had been destroyed by fire, and nearly all the
people burned.</p>

<p>The closing up of a matter of his former business
had called Mr. Allen to that city some two weeks previous,
and as it was past the time set for his return,
the rumor brought by the timberman filled the family
with alarm. Letters were rare with dwellers in that
forest wilderness, but occasional trips were made to
Dexter Crossing, where &#8220;tote&#8221; teams passing to the
camps along the rivers of the far north would leave
mail forwarded on to these settlers by the postmasters
at the towns below.</p>

<p>Rob being the elder of the boys, proposed to make
the trip at once to Dexter Crossing in the chance of a
letter having been sent there to them by their father.
There was, of course, danger that the great fire of
the northeast might sweep down upon them any day,
and as Dexter was well within the big woods the fate
of one caught out there could be fearfully imagined.
But the anxiety of the family as to the safety of Mr.
Allen outweighed their caution, and Mrs. Allen gave
her consent for Rob to make the trip.</p>

<p>The lad reached the settlement at Dexter Crossing
safely, and to his joy found there a letter from his
father. A great fire had indeed swept over the very
heart of Chicago, destroying almost the entire business
portion, and hundreds of lives had been lost. Fortunately
Mr. Allen had been in a district not reached
by the flames, and while he had been delayed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
catastrophe, would be able to reach home the following
week.</p>

<p>Impatient to be back at home with the good news,
Rob resolved to start upon the return trip that night,
walking ten miles or so, then resting until daybreak.
Thoroughly wearied with his long tramp, he slept
soundly when he finally lay down upon his bed of pine
&#8220;needles.&#8221; When he awoke it was with a start and
sense of discomfort. His watch said it was morning,
past six o&#8217;clock, although it was still dark. The air
was close and heavy and carried a pungent odor that
made breathing somewhat difficult. Rob sprang to his
feet, and munching his bread and bacon as he went,
resumed his journey. Before he had traveled an hour,
the tops of the tall pines had begun to moan in a rising
wind, and a cloud of smoke was settling down like a
pall from the sky. With a clutch of fear at his heart,
Rob realized the meaning&mdash;the forest fire had reached
that section; his hope of safety lay in reaching the
more open country about his home before the storm
of fire should be upon him.</p>

<p>Breaking into a &#8220;long run,&#8221; an exercise which the
boys had practiced until they were able to keep up the
gait for two or three miles, Rob began the race. The
smoke grew more dense; tears ran down the boy&#8217;s face
from smarting eyes. Choking for air, he bound his
handkerchief about his mouth and nose, and ran on.
Again and again he would stumble and fall over tree-roots
rising in the way. Finally he noticed that close
to the ground there was a current of cool, pure air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and so, lying flat on his face, he would fill his lungs,
then rise and dash forward as far as he could, and
fall to the earth to breathe again.</p>

<p>While he lay gasping for breath after a long run,
there came to his ears the sound as of a waterfall in
the distance. The volume of sound increased until it
became a roar, and all at once the pall of darkness
broke out into a glare of blinding flame&mdash;the tempest
of fire was upon him. The very air seemed to be on
fire. A great pine would start into a blaze, and an
ascending current of air snatching a limb or a burning
bunch of cones would hurl it on into the top of another
tree an hundred feet away. The first rush was quickly
over. The resinous foliage of the green trees was soon
licked up by the flames, but the awful destruction
would continue for days.</p>

<p>The bed of dry &#8220;needles,&#8221; fallen leaves of the yearly
shedding of the pines, made excellent kindling to light
the great trunks of the forest giants, which, catching,
would burn until consumed, or until extinguished by
a heavy rain. Fortunately the latter usually occurred.
Whether or not it be founded in fact, there is a saying
widely accepted that every large battle and great fire
is followed by a hard rainstorm. Thus it is that the
greatest damage in forest fires is to the young timber,
the small trees growing close together being left bare
and dead, if not consumed at once. Among the big
trees there is little underbrush, and while the foliage
and small limbs are destroyed, and great holes sometimes
burned in the trunks near the ground, the trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
recover, and put forth their green again the following
spring.</p>

<p>All sense seemed to leave Rob except the one to keep
going. No longer could he stand to run more than
a few feet in the fierce heat. His hair was singed; the
thick soles of his boots were cracked and shriveled up
from stepping upon embers and burning limbs. His
woolen jacket and trousers were a protection to his
body, but when a dead tree, all ablaze, fell with a
crash just in front of him, he felt that he could
go no further. Almost without volition he crawled
off to one side&mdash;and for a time lost consciousness. Soon
he came to himself and realized that his blistered face
and hands were deliciously cool, and that he was
breathing easily. He had fortunately crawled into a
little &#8220;swale,&#8221; one of the small, moss-covered depressions
that mark the edge of the big forest, as it opens
out into the small timber and marshes of the ancient
lake. The little basin, filled with moss, was like a great
sponge from which not all the moisture had been
wrung by the fierce heat of the summer, and it meant
life to Rob as he buried his face in it.</p>

<p>Danger to the lad from falling trees and flying firebrands
was not over, but he was not far from the open
prairie, now a blackened waste, and with heart anxious
for the loved ones at home, he pushed on.</p>

<p>The fire had, after all, not been connected with the
great fire of the northeast, but was local in extent,
covering some ten miles from north to south, and perhaps
fifteen from its eastern starting point, to where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
it was stopped by the deep marshes on the west. The
humble home on the Necedah river was unharmed, and
great was the rejoicing that night as Rob returned
alive, with the letter, although it was many weeks before
the lad fully recovered from the experiences of
that fearful trip through the burning forest.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>THE FIRST DEER HUNT</small></h2></div>


<p>The question of food supply is always an important
one where there is a family of growing children, but
especially is it so in a wilderness of forest, far from
stores and the supplies of towns and cities. The question
is not so much one of variety as of quantity, as
the vigorous out-of-door life of the pioneer gives an
appetite which dainties prepared by a famous <i>chef</i>
would not tempt from the generous dish of &#8220;pork and
beans,&#8221; or roast beef and potatoes.</p>

<p>This question became a pressing one to our settlers
in the &#8220;old lake bottom,&#8221; by the Necedah river. The
severe summer drouth had cut short the yield of their
potato crop upon which high hopes had rested at the
spring planting, and a great horde of migrating squirrels
had harvested their little field of corn before it
had ripened.</p>

<p>Ruffled grouse, or &#8220;prairie-chickens,&#8221; as they were
called, were abundant up to the time of the big fires
in August. Indeed, from the first of July the young
birds had furnished a supply of meat for the table
more delicious than the boys of the family had ever
known.</p>

<p>The old sow, which they had succeeded in bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
through the winter, had been turned out into
the hardwood timber along the river to care for herself,
and Uncle Sam Thompson reported having seen her
on Big Bend with a fine litter of pigs, which would
thrive upon the &#8220;mast,&#8221; the nuts of oak and hickory,
and furnish good &#8220;hams&#8221; and &#8220;sides&#8221; by Christmas.</p>

<p>The fire which had come down out of the big woods
during the summer, burning over the low prairies and
shallow marches had been followed by a week of heavy
rains, and what had been a wide stretch of blackened
waste was soon transformed by the springing grass
into an emerald garden. While light frosts occasionally
nipped the top, through September, the grass grew
rapidly and luxuriantly, and Mr. Allen&#8217;s few cows
and yoke of young oxen were rolling with fat by
October.</p>

<p>Families and herds of deer might be seen any day
a mile west from the Allen home, though they appeared
to be more difficult of approach as the cold
season came on. As many as twenty in one herd were
counted by the boys at one time. While they had become
expert with their guns in securing small game,
neither Rob nor Ed had as yet tried their marksmanship
upon the larger animals.</p>

<p>There was, at that time, no &#8220;closed&#8221; season for its
protection, but the settlers, as a rule, never killed game
wantonly, nor for &#8220;sport.&#8221; No deer were shot in the
summer, especially while the young needed the care
of its mother. But when the sharp, frosty nights of
October came, the hunter&#8217;s appetite was allowed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
match the woods-wisdom and cunning of the &#8220;antlered
lords of the forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The moonlight nights of October is the mating season,
and then the hunters know that the deer keep to
regular paths or &#8220;runs&#8221; through the forest. Rough
platforms of boughs were built upon the low branches
of some tree at the crossing or intersection of two runs,
and upon this the hunter will take his seat and watch,
while a comrade starts off, and making a wide detour,
starts a &#8220;drive&#8221; in the direction of the ambush. The
watcher in the tree must be alert, quick of sight, and
sure of aim, for the buck will come bounding toward
him with prodigious leaps and be gone again in a
flash.</p>

<p>Uncle Sam had promised his nephew Dauphin and
the Allen boys a deer hunt on the night of the full
moon in October, but Rob Allen was impatient. &#8220;You
needn&#8217;t be in such a hurry,&#8221; said Dauphin. &#8220;You
couldn&#8217;t hit a deer the first time, anyway. One always
has &#8216;buck-fever&#8217; the first time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see,&#8221; boasted Rob; &#8220;I&#8217;ll show you that the
laugh will not be on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Rob had been wise, he would have awaited the
time set, and acted under the direction of the experienced
hunter, but the taunt of Dauphin spurred him on
to prove his prowess. So the next afternoon he slipped
off with his gun in the direction of Round Slough.
Approaching the water from the west he came to a
swale where some long-past tornado from the southwest
had laid the aspen trees in great windrows. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
breeze from the east brought to Rob the quacking of
ducks over in the slough, and as he slowly and as
quietly as possible, clambered over the fallen tree
trunks, he thought, &#8220;Well, I can change the buckshot
in my gun to a cartridge of 4&#8217;s, and take home a mess
of mallards anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, from the further side of the very windrow
of tree trunks upon which he was clambering, there
sprang high into the air, and in a mighty bound clearing
the last barrier of trees, a splendid, eight-pronged
buck. For a second Rob stood in open-mouthed wonder,
then seizing his gun in one hand he started on a
run after the deer, yelling at the top of his voice.
There was a flash of the great antlers above the underbrush
of the slough, and the deer was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Rob, coming to himself, &#8220;I had it,
didn&#8217;t I! So that is &#8216;buck fever.&#8217; Why I never once
thought of my gun. The boys will have their laugh
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Coming out into the open forest, the lad struck
into a deer &#8220;run&#8221; and started for home. He had not
gone far when he caught the sound of animals running,
coming toward him. Quickly he dodged behind a big
pine. In a moment two deer burst into sight, the second
one carrying a pair of branching antlers. Rob
could feel his heart beating like a trip-hammer, but
he drew a bead upon the antlers, and, just as they
passed, fired. The buck dropped, rolled over and over,
then lay still.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; shouted Rob. &#8220;I have you now;&#8221; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
dropping his gun, he ran quickly, drawing his hunting
knife. The deer was a four-year-old, and would probably
weigh a hundred and fifty pounds. The boy
put one foot upon the neck of the fallen animal, when
a startling thing occurred. As though the solid earth
had risen beneath his feet, Rob felt himself lifted and
flung over upon his back on the pine needles as if he
had been the merest trifle, and in great leaps and
bounds he saw his deer disappearing in the distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of all things,&#8221; gasped the lad, &#8220;this beats me.
If I caught the &#8216;buck fever&#8217; the first time, I must now
have reached the delirious stage. Who ever heard of
a dead deer acting in that way!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was now growing dark, and impossible to follow
the trail of the deer even had it been seriously wounded,
so the lad struck out for home. He had gone perhaps
half a mile, and was approaching the open prairie
not far from his home, when, in a small swale, to the
left of the trail, he heard a snort, then a quick, impatient
pawing of a hoof like a challenge. Dropping
to his knees he waited, and in a moment discovered the
gleam of two eyes shining through the darkness. Carefully
raising his gun, he fired. Springing straight
up into the air, the animal came down with a thud.
This time Rob did not throw down his gun, but made
ready with the second barrel in case of need, as he
cautiously went up to where his quarry lay. But the
charge had gone true, and a fine, fat yearling, a &#8220;spike&#8221;
buck&mdash;his first deer&mdash;was a prize to the young hunter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>The boy&#8217;s heart beat proudly as he shouldered his
game and bore it home.</p>

<p>With well assumed modesty Rob accepted the praises
of Dauphin and Ed, but being an honest lad he finally
confessed to his attack of &#8220;buck fever,&#8221; and then related
the astonishing action of the second deer.</p>

<p>But Uncle Sam explained it. &#8220;You &#8216;creased&#8217; him,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Your aim was too high, but one of the buckshot
grazed the top of his head and stunned him for
the time. Probably he was not at all seriously hurt.
I saw that trick played many a time when we were
crossing the plains to California in an early day.
When we were on the llanos of northern and western
Texas bands of wild horses would occasionally circle
about our wagon train. None of the saddle horses
were anything like a match for the wild fellows in
speed, but the plainsmen had a way of occasionally
capturing one of the band. Where the lay of the ground
would permit, a picked man would be detailed to creep
toward the herd until within shooting distance. Selecting
the horse that pleased his fancy, he would
shoot, not to kill or wound the animal, but to just graze
the skin along the top of its head. The trick required
the highest skill in marksmanship, but many horses
were secured in that way, as the force of the bullet
would stun the animal for a time and it could be
secured with ropes, and finally be broken to service.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>THE INDIAN WAR DANCE</small></h2></div>


<p>When the Jesuit Fathers, those early French path-finders
for civilization in the central region of the
American continent, pushed down from Canada over
the lakes and by the rivers into the great forest that
stretched from the inland sea to the great river, they
found a people warlike, indeed, yet hospitable and
kindly; reserved and shy, yet open-hearted and unsuspicious;
uncivilized according to Old World standards,
yet wise in the great secrets of nature; poor as
to stores of gold, yet rich in the abundance of all that
went to make for their simple necessities, their comfort
and their pleasure. So entranced were the Frenchmen
with the natural, free, and abundant life of these
red men of the forest, and with their noble physical
bearing, and untutored courtesy and dignity, that many
then and there forever forsook the land and ways of
their fathers, and bequeathed the names of France to
dusky families, and to streams and lakes and heights.</p>

<p>The Great Sioux Nation, not a people, but a federation
of peoples, lay principally to the west&mdash;the
land of Hiawatha&mdash;in what was to become Minnesota,
and extended well across the barren plains of Dakota
to the Missouri river where possession was disputed
by the Blackfeet. The eastern border of the nation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
rested upon the shores of the two fresh water seas.
The central portion of the great forest was the home,
principally, of two tribes: to the eastward the Menominees,
and to the westward the Winnebagoes. To
the south was the land of the Sac and Fox.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of the red man, this land between
the Mississippi river and the great lakes could
only be equalled by that Happy Hunting Ground on
the Isle of the Blest, the home of Manitou, the Great
Spirit. Little lakes and running streams, teeming
with fish, abounded. Wild fowl and the smaller fur-
and game-animals were ever within reach of even the
arrows of the unclad children. Blackberries grew in
riotous profusion in sandy openings of the forest;
while blueberries in the summer and huckleberries in
early fall gave a welcome change of diet. Food was
plentiful. And as for wild creatures whose taking
would test the sagacity and valor of the wisest and
bravest, were there not the bear, the panther, and the
lynx? While upon the plains west of the great river
the neighbors depended upon the bison for winter&#8217;s
meat, for tent covering and a large portion of their
clothing, the great forest afforded the Winnebagoes,
for these necessities, the flesh and skins of deer.</p>

<p>It is true that such a bountiful nature bred an
improvident disposition, and times of lack and suffering
had come to them in the past, but so rare were they,
that the tales of such disasters became great epics to
be rehearsed and chanted about winter fires.</p>

<p>To this forest had come the welcomed priests and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
their friendly companions&mdash;but that was indeed the
beginning of a new order; where one white man puts
a foot, there other white men spring up. It would
seem strange that from the time of pathfinder Pierre
Marquette to the time of pathfinder John C. Fremont,
the simple, free, self-sufficient lives of these forest
tribes should have been so little disturbed, and yet
there was a reason. From the Atlantic coast the white
man&#8217;s civilization had spread westward, ever westward,
opening up farms, building cities&mdash;always
crowding before it the red man, and appropriating
his lands. After the bloody days of the establishing
of New England upon the eastern shore, there came,
later, Tecumseh, with his vain hope of stemming the
tide of invasion. Then still later, in the newer west,
Black Hawk, with impassioned words strove to turn
the faces of his warriors toward the coming horde.
But steadily, surely, the white man pressed forward.
As a stream is turned aside by a barrier, to seek some
other and easier course, so was this human stream of
immigration and occupation for a long time held back
by the vast forests of Wisconsin. As yet there was no
lack of fertile prairies ready for the plow, and so the
tide swept below and on around the home of the Winnebagoes.
It crept up into Minnesota, and, still westward,
planted its outpost at beautiful little lake Cheteck,
the head of the Des Moines river. Here the red
men of the plains called a halt. From Cheteck to
New Ulm they wrote their fearful warning in blood
and fire. The answer of the whites was quick and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
less terrible, and so relentless, that many of these plains
folk took refuge among their neighbors in the Winnebago
forests. For three hundred years the history
of the Winnebagoes and Menominees had been one of
almost unbroken peace with the whites. While there
had been settlements made here and there, so far there
had been no serious crowding. There was yet room and
food in plenty; and abundance of food predisposes to
peace.</p>

<p>But the white dwellers of the cities and on the
plains farms increased; always new homes were to be
built; the small forests were soon exhausted, and the
lumber scout came on to view the great woods of Wisconsin.</p>

<p>In early days when white men desired the skin
of otter or beaver possessed by an Indian he might give
the red man a bit of copper wire as barter, but he took
the skin. So it was when the great forests of pine and
oak and ash became desirable to the white man, he did
not steal outright the home of the red man; he made
some sort of present in return, as he took the land.
To the Winnebagoes was allotted, as exchange for their
claim to the forests which had sheltered and nourished
the generations of their ancestors, a treeless, waterless
tract in the far south, in what had been called the
&#8220;Indian Territory.&#8221; To be sure they had had nothing
to say as to the trade, and entertained no notion of
going to their new &#8220;home,&#8221; but the white man had appeased
his conscience, and the red man would now be
considered an intruder in the forest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>When Rob and Ed Allen came with their father&#8217;s
family to live upon the Necedah river there was a
band of perhaps an hundred Winnebagoes making
their lodge in Big Bend. The chief, following custom,
had taken a &#8220;white&#8221; name, after that of a man
who had befriended him, and was known, not as Jim
Miner, but as &#8220;Miner Jim.&#8221; Miner Jim&#8217;s wife was the
daughter of a Menominee chief, and was called by the
whites &#8220;Menominee Mary.&#8221; Mary was every inch a
red princess. Magnificently proportioned, and of nature
imperious, her word held at least equal authority
in the tribe with the chief. While it was customary
among the Indians for a brave, and especially a chief,
to have several wives, Menominee Mary reigned the
sole spouse in the tepee of the Winnebago chief. Their
eldest child was Ka-li-cha-goo-gah, and, according to
Indian custom, which traces descent through mother
to son, instead of through father to son, the lad was
considered a Menominee.</p>

<p>Between this Indian lad of about their own age, and
the Allen boys, and their neighbor, Dauphin Thompson,
there sprang up a warm friendship. The white
boys and the red one were together upon many a hunting
trip, and in the berry season gathered their basswood-bark
baskets full of fruit side by side. Buckskin
moccasins ornamented with elaborate beadwork
designs by Menominee Mary, broad, ash-bowed snow
shoes for winter hunting, and a soft, lynx-fur robe attested
the love the son of the chief bore his white comrades.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
And in return his delight was great in the
gift of a score of steel traps with which he would
gather in a harvest of muskrat pelts from the lodges
on Iron Creek marsh during the months of deep snow.
Living as members of this band were two young people,
a boy nearly grown, whose red, stubby hair, and
smiling, freckled face was, as Dauphin declared, a
&#8220;plain map of Ireland.&#8221; The other was a girl apparently
twelve or thirteen years of age, with wavy,
dark brown hair, and eyes as blue as a summer sky.
Whether these young folk were able to speak English,
the white boys could not tell. They never answered
a question put to them in that tongue, and the older
Indians seemed adverse to having them associate with
the white lads. Uncle Sam Thompson told the boys
the story of the Minnesota massacre and gave, as his
suspicion, that some of this band of the Big Bend were
really refugees from the Sioux who were in that uprising,
and that the two evidently white children were
really captives taken at that time.</p>

<p>During the year of which I write the boys had been
freely received at the Indian camp, and, what few
whites had been permitted to behold, had been allowed
to attend their stated occasions of worship, the
ceremonial dances. The Fish Dance in the spring, the
Green Corn Dance in the summer, the Harvest Dance
and the Hunting Moon Dance in the autumn, were of
strange interest to these town-bred boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you what I&#8217;d like to see,&#8221; said Ed Allen,
as they were going home from one of these, to them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
grotesque performances, &#8220;I would like to go to a sure-enough
scalp dance, or war dance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can be thankful, young man,&#8221; replied Dauphin,
&#8220;that you are permitted to see what you have
seen without having those other dances added. White
men who have been spectators have seldom found either
of these performances pleasant, if indeed they had
any opportunity to tell about them afterward.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the winter season approached, there seemed to
come a change in the attitude of the Indians toward
their visitors. Kalichigoogah was often silent and
moody with his friends, and the older Indians, while
never rude, offered little welcome to the whites.</p>

<p>There had been a series of more or less disastrous
fires here and there in the great forest, and the lumbermen
who were busily gaining title to these lands
laid the blame upon the Indians. The representation
they made to the government at Washington was that
the Indians, if not revengefully guilty, were at least
carelessly so, as forest fires would be sure to be kindled
from their campfires. Moreover, they declared, the
Winnebagoes were trespassers in the forest; the government
had allotted them a reservation in the Indian
Territory, and they called upon the authorities at
Washington to see that these Indians were &#8220;returned&#8221;
to the place where they belonged.</p>

<p>To one acquainted with the manner of Indian life,
the charge that forest fires were set from the campfires
of the red men, would be ridiculous. Such fires
might, and doubtless did, start from the campfires of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
white hunters and timber scouts, but never from a
fire built by an Indian. In the first place, the forest
was the very life of the Indian. He understood that
any harm to the big woods meant harm to himself.
A white man would build his fire by a log or dry
stump, and pile on plenty of sticks and limbs. He
would have a big fire&mdash;and go away leaving it burning
careless of consequences. On the contrary, the
Indian, who for generations had lived in the possible
presence of a keen-eyed enemy, was very cautious about
letting a smoke rise above the tree tops to call attention
to himself. Consequently his fire was small&mdash;just a
few little sticks, or pieces of bark brought together,
and <i>always</i> the fire extinguished, and generally the
very ashes concealed, as the hunter or warrior left
his camping place.</p>

<p>Friends among the whites had sent word to the
Winnebagoes of the purpose of the Great Father at
Washington to take them from the land of their fathers
and hold them upon the bleak prairies where there was
no forest shade, no cool lakes, no sparkling rivers, but
fierce winds, and dust clouds, and marauding Comanches.</p>

<p>The red man is called cruel and treacherous, but
to the Winnebagoes the white race, at this time, seemed
the incarnation of all that is unjust and hateful. It
is small wonder that Miner Jim&#8217;s band grew moody,
and distant in their attitude toward their former
friends.</p>

<p>Spring came in somewhat late. Up until April the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
river was still floating large cakes of ice. In that
latitude the corn-growing season is none too long at
best, and the Allen boys would have to make every
hour count when the land became dry enough to work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rob,&#8221; said Ed, one bright, warm day, &#8220;I believe
that upper meadow could be plowed now, if we had another
yoke of steers to hitch to our 14-inch plow. I&#8217;m
going over to see if Dauph won&#8217;t hitch in with his
steers for a few days and work time about.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was late in the evening before Ed and Dauphin
finished their arrangements for the partnership plowing,
and when Ed reached Big Bend, twilight had
fallen over the prairie; within the wood it was already
dark. The long-drawn cry of a grey timber
wolf came sharp and clear to the boy on the frosty
spring air. In a moment it was answered by the
house dogs of the distant farm. A Great Horned Owl,
lingering late before departing for his summer home
in the arctic region, boomed a deep-voiced &#8220;Hoo-hoo-ah&#8221;
as it arose like a ghost all in white from a limb
above the path. Then there came to the ears of the
boy other sounds, so strange and confusing that he
was compelled to stop and listen. Evidently the
noise was over in Big Bend. The Indian camp! But
what was going on? The Indians are not accustomed
to much noise making. Could it be that some vicious
white man, as had occurred at other places, had brought
in the forbidden &#8220;fire water&#8221; to inflame and debauch
the red men for their own evil ends?</p>

<p>For himself, the lad did not think of being afraid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
These Indians were his friends. If wicked white men
were there, seeking them harm, his father would see
that they received merited punishment. It was not yet
late; he could easily reach home in time. He would
go over to the Indian camp and learn the cause of the
commotion.</p>

<p>As he drew near, a lean cur with hair standing like
bristles upon its back, made a dash at his heels, but
slunk away as it took the familiar scent of one it had
learned was a friend. As the lad came within fifty
yards of the place he had a view of what was going
on. A large space to the east of the camp had been
cleared, and around this space, in a circle, were squatted
the women and children of the tribe. Small fires,
here and there, but partially lit up the camp, and threw
weird shadows, now upon the surrounding forest, now
upon the cleared ground. All about in the circle were
different ones beating upon tom-toms, small drums
fashioned by stretching buckskin tightly over ash
hoops. They were chanting some song in a high-pitched,
monotonous, though not unmusical tone, and
in perfect cadence. Ed&#8217;s gaze lifted from the musicians
to the top of the pole planted in the center of
the circle, from which dangled&mdash;what was it? Hair!
Yes, unmistakably, a number of dried human scalps.
A cold hand seemed to grip the spine of the boy, and
each individual hair of his head seemed trying to pull
itself out by the roots. He sank to the thick bed of
pine needles on the ground, thankful that he had been
standing in the shadow of a great tree.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>It was well that he was hidden, for just then began
the strangest ceremony he had ever witnessed,
and which few, indeed, of the white race had ever
beheld and come away to describe. The Indians sprang
into the circle, stark naked save for the narrow loin-cloth,
their bodies painted black, with broad red and
yellow stripes, their faces &#8220;decorated&#8221; with hideous
lines and patches of color. Those who had been warriors,
wore upon their heads the bonnet or headdress
ornamented with eagle feathers, each feather marking
some great deed, which the voice of the old
men of the tribe had decided to be a claim to honor.
The younger Indians had each one or two, or possibly
three feathers fastened in the thick braids of
black hair which hung down their backs. As they
sprang into the circle, it could be seen that all carried
some kind of weapon. With bodies swaying and
gesticulating, they went around and around, one following
the other, in perfect time with the beating of
the tom-toms and the shrill singing of the women. At
first all seemed to be a confusion of gesture, but as the
dance proceeded the boy on the ground saw that each
Indian was acting out in pantomime a story, and that
story was the pursuit, capture, and death of an enemy.
Crouching, crawling, springing, running, aiming with
gun, striking with tomahawk, scalping with the knife,
and leaping away in triumph, all were unmistakably
portrayed by the redmen dancing in perfect rhythm
about the scalp-decked pole.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a war dance,&#8221; gasped the watching lad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
&#8220;They&#8217;re getting ready to go on the war path. I must
get home and warn the folks&mdash;if I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly he began to crawl backward into the deeper
shadows, away from that fearful place. What if the
dogs should come upon him and bark, even in sport?
What if quick ears should hear the snap of a broken
twig? Would they not think him a spy? Would they
take him along as a prisoner; or would they build a
fire about that pole in the center and tie him there
after having added his scalp to their collection?</p>

<p>It seemed that he was hours in crawling backward
out of the light of those fires, away from the horrid
din, away from the all too suggestive dancing of those
hideous, naked figures. All at once he found himself
at the river bank. Creeping down, he quietly let himself
into the cold water, and clutching grass and root,
and overhanging branch, he cautiously, and with painful
slowness, made his way down stream. He was
numb with the fright of his experience, as well as the
chill of the water, and scarcely able to walk, when he
reached the opening of the forest, half a mile from the
Indian camp. As he was about entering the path leading
to his home, he stumbled and nearly fell over someone
lying prostrate on the dead leaves.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is some watcher. I&#8217;m lost,&#8221; flashed through the
mind of the boy. But a familiar movement of an arm
of the stretched-out figure caught his attention. Could
it be? it was Kalichigoogah. For some moments the
Indian boy would answer no question of his white
friend, but finally he burst out in a sob.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>&#8220;Me no let dance. Me no let fight. Them say no
Winnebago, me Menominee.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two white families made such preparations as
were possible to withstand an attack, but no harm appeared
during the night, and a cautious investigation
the following day showed the camp deserted; the
women and children as well as the war party gone.</p>

<p>Two days later the cause for the strange action
of the Indians was learned, when Captain Hunt, in
charge of a squad of regular soldiers, appeared at the
home of Mr. Thompson. The Indians had been warned
that the petition of the lumbermen had been granted
by the authorities at Washington, and that they were
to be forcibly removed from their forest home to the
inhospitable plains of the South. They did not seek
war with their brothers, but they would not tamely
give up their home. They would take the women and
children to the friendly care of the Menominee, and
then, if they must, they would die as befitted a brave
race.</p>

<p>The soldiers easily caught the trail of the fleeing
band, and on the third day after the war dance, the
entire band, women, children, and warriors, were surrounded,
captured, and taken away to the Indian Territory.</p>

<p>I may say that the stay of these Winnebagoes upon
their reservation was not long. One after another,
stragglers from the band came back, until before the
close of the second season the majority were again
living in their beloved forest home.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>THE FLOATING BOG</small></h2></div>


<p>In settling up some business affairs, Mr. Allen had
come into possession of a tract of two thousand acres
of swamp land lying toward the western side of the
bed of the ancient sea. At the time of which I write
there were vast tracts of such supposedly valueless land
owned by the state, and which could be purchased for
ten dollars per &#8220;forty,&#8221; twenty-five cents per acre.
Timber scouts had ranged over it, and selecting the
forties upon which there were sand knolls covered with
a goodly amount of pine timber, the land would be
purchased by their employers, the lumber companies,
to be cut over at their convenience.</p>

<p>The low-lying prairies, flooded in the spring season,
and the lower marshes covered with water much of the
year, were thought to be not worth the twenty-five
cents per acre asked by the state. In later years, by
a system of drainage, and through scientific farming,
much of this land became highly productive and valuable.</p>

<p>In some of the deeper marshes, where there had
been an abundance of water for several years, cranberry
vines had covered the surface of the moss and
yielded astonishing crops of mottled green and red
berries. This was the character of much of the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of which Mr. Allen found himself possessed. A granite
rock rising with nearly perpendicular sides over
three hundred feet above the level surface of the country,
gave the name of North Bluff marsh to the locality,
as distinguished from the country about a similar
bluff some ten miles to the south.</p>

<p>After considerable persuasion on the part of the
boys, Mr. Allen had leased this cranberry marsh to
Rob and Ed, and their chum Dauphin. The boys already
had a good start on the fund they were gathering
for a planned year in college, and if they should be
successful in getting the berries from the North Bluff
to market, it would bring them nearer to the desired
goal.</p>

<p>While the cranberry, as it is picked from the vine,
is as firm and meaty as a little apple, it bruises easily
in handling, and so requires great care in getting to
market. The boys had purposed using two-bushel
grain sacks for the transportation of the crop, but
Mr. Allen wisely persuaded them to make a preliminary
trip to Lisbon and secure light ash barrels to
take with them to the marsh and so prevent much
loss from bruised and damaged berries.</p>

<p>On the twentieth of August the boys had their outfits
assembled: two yokes of oxen hitched to two broad-tired
wagons, upon which were long racks each containing
thirty empty barrels. With these they carried
a tent, cooking utensils, supplies of bacon, flour, brown
sugar, matches, axes, guns, and ammunition, sacks to
carry the berries from the marsh to dry land, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
least in importance, three cranberry rakes. Of these
latter Uncle Sam Thompson had made one for each
of the boys. A slab of ash was taken and fingers about
ten inches long sawn and whittled down smooth in
one end. Sides and back were put to this, with a handle
on top and back. With these &#8220;rakes&#8221; the boys
would literally scoop up the berries from the vines.</p>

<p>The trip of fifty miles to the marsh was, in itself,
a great undertaking. There were no roads; logs and
tree roots had to be chopped out of the way, and overhanging
limbs cleared from before the stacks of barrels.
More serious were the occasional deep bogs encountered,
through which the oxen, though accustomed
to wallowing in mud, were unable to pull the wagons.
Over these the boys were obliged to build a &#8220;corduroy,&#8221;
sometimes for several rods. To one accustomed
to a boulevard or even a macadam pike, the corduroy
would seem an impossibility as a means of travel, but
pioneers are frequently required to accomplish the
seemingly impossible. Small trees are felled and cut
into lengths suitable to the width of the wagon, and
these placed side by side until the way across has been
covered. When the marsh is unusually deep and soft,
a second layer of smaller logs is placed upon the first.
It is not a good road, nor easy to ride over, but it can
be crossed, and that is the main thing.</p>

<p>Not alone were the bad roads, or lack of roads, a
cause of distress to the boys and their teams; mosquitoes
in clouds attacked them day and night. Frequently
they were compelled to make &#8220;smudges&#8221; of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
fire covered with green grass, so that in the smoke they
might be able to eat their meals in some sort of comfort.
At night the oxen were likewise protected from
the attacks of the pestiferous insects. Much annoyance
and no little suffering were caused by a spotted
fly, called from its markings, the &#8220;deer fly,&#8221; which
persistently crawled up into their hair and under
their clothing, its bite always drawing blood.</p>

<p>The boys averaged not quite five miles a day on
the trip, and it was the last day of August before the
camping place at the foot of North Bluff was reached.</p>

<p>The first day of their arrival was spent in arranging
camp; putting up the tent, digging the shallow well
in the sand at the marsh&#8217;s edge, and building moss-lined
pole-pens in which to store the berries as they should
be picked. Cranberry harvest and the arrival of frost
are usually too close together to allow any time to be
taken away from the one occupation of picking. So
the boys would sort over and clean the berries and then
barrel them after the frosts had come.</p>

<p>The bog was a wonder to the Allen boys. Around
the edge, for perhaps ten rods out into the marsh, were
growing tamarack trees, from little switches a dozen
feet high that could be easily pulled up by hand, to
older ones six inches in diameter, and thirty feet in
height. Further out, beyond the line of tamaracks, the
bog looked much like a prairie covered with moss,
with here and there a sandy mound upon which blackberry
vines, huckleberry bushes, and a few scattering
pine trees were growing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>When they had walked out into the marsh several
rods over shoe-top deep in the moss, Dauphin called
out, &#8220;Stand still a minute, boys, I want to show you
something,&#8221; and he began to spring up and down in
rhythmic motion. In a few moments, at first slightly,
then in increasing motion the trees began to sway and
bend, and the surface of the bog, for many rods around,
could be seen in regular, wave-like motion, trees and
all rising and falling, bending and rolling as if on
the bosom of a rolling sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is like this,&#8221; said Dauphin in answer to the
boys&#8217; astonished questioning, &#8220;this marsh is really
a lake over which the moss has grown until it is now
completely covered. Here, near the edge where it started
in to grow and spread over the water, the old moss
falling down each year has been succeeded by the new
growing up, and so for ages, until there is now quite a
solid covering at the surface, enough even to support
the trees, but, as you see, it is only after all a floating
cover to a lake. Not all over is the moss so thick as
here, and there are places dangerous to try to walk
over. One might easily drop through. Then&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Dauph,&#8221; exclaimed Ed; &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to
think of anything so horrible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had best pick your steps, then,&#8221; replied Dauphin;
&#8220;if you attempt to cross the bog, or you may
find something worse than hearing about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far is it to the bottom?&#8221; asked Rob.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can soon see,&#8221; replied Dauphin. Cutting
down a slender dead tamarack he thrust it down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
through the moss until it rested upon the solid sand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twelve feet!&#8221; exclaimed the boys as the pole was
drawn up and measured. Further out from the edge
they took a measurement of sixteen feet from the
mossy surface to the bottom.</p>

<p>There was a fine crop of cranberries on the vines,
and the boys were busy from early morning until late
at night with their rakes. The unaccustomed stooping
all day was back-breaking work, and it was not at all
pleasant to stand in cold water wet to the knees, but
the two-bushel sack of berries each boy was able to
carry to camp every half day made the labor endurable.</p>

<p>As the best patches near the camp were soon raked
over, the boys would take turns searching for new
places. On one of these excursions Rob had an adventure
which came near to a tragedy for him, but
which led to happy termination. In a cove of perhaps
an acre, jutting up into one of the pine islands, lying
nearly a mile out into the bog, Rob found a patch of
beautiful &#8220;bell&#8221; berries, and over near the edge it appeared
as though the vines had been recently disturbed.
Closely scanning the land nearby he at length
discovered a mound of freshly-pulled moss over which
pine boughs had been carelessly strewn, as if in attempt
to hide something. His curiosity was of course
aroused, and digging away the moss he came upon
several sacks filled with berries. Evidently somebody
had been there at work. He determined to carry one
of the sacks of berries to camp with him, and then get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the boys and hunt for the trespassers. Instead of returning
in the way he came, Rob struck out straight
across the bog, his mind full of excited imaginings
about his find. Suddenly he found himself dropping,
and like a flash he realized that he had come upon a
thin place in the bog, and was falling through to the
cold, dark depths of the lake beneath. Instinctively
he had thrown himself forward, with arms out-stretched,
his hands clutching the moss. This stayed
him for a moment, but the heavy sack of berries was
upon him, forcing his head and shoulders down into
the moss. He could feel himself sinking; the water
seemed to be rising about his face. He thought of how
the boys would miss him, of their fruitless search, for
the moss would soon close over him leaving no mark
to show where he had gone down. Then the thought
came that he must not die; that he might work backward
from under the sack and get free. It was a desperate
struggle, and before he succeeded his face was
under water, and his strength nearly exhausted for
lack of breath. But at last he was free, and throwing
his arms up over the sack he raised his head, regained
his breath, and rested. Slowly he pulled his body up,
and using the sinking sack for a foothold, he threw
himself sprawling upon the track over which he had
come. He crawled in the moss for several yards before
he dared to rise to his feet and resume his journey
to the camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to see that lake drained,&#8221; said Dauphin,
as Rob told of his narrow escape. &#8220;Think of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
different kinds of animals that have probably left
their bones on the sands of that lake bottom in the ages
past.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad that your future scientist will not
have the pleasure of classifying my bones, anyway,&#8221;
replied Rob.</p>

<p>Next day the boys found the trespassers to be a
band of Winnebago Indians, and they were able to
make satisfactory arrangements whereby the Indians
stayed and helped them harvest the crop of berries,
which the boys finally got safely to market.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>THE WAYSIDE TAVERN</small></h2></div>


<p>&#8220;Uncle Henry,&#8221; said Ed, as the boys were enjoying
themselves in the pleasant living room of the Thompson
home, &#8220;what kind of a mound is that in front of
Slater&#8217;s tavern? It looks like a grave right there in
front of the house. I noticed it when I was going to
Lisbon after cranberry barrels last fall, and I started
to ask Mr. Slater who had been buried there, but one
of the teamsters stopping there for dinner with me
looked scared, and hushed me up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruth can tell you the story; it&#8217;s mighty sad,&#8221;
replied Mr. Thompson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, boys, it is indeed a sad story, but its lesson
may do you good,&#8221; replied Mrs. Thompson.</p>

<p>And this is the story she related.</p>

<p>Among the pioneers of settlement in the great forest
wilderness of northern Wisconsin, were Jared
Slater, a middle-aged tavernkeeper, from Vermont, and
his young wife. Margaret Strong had been left an orphan
at an early age, and had gone into domestic
service as her only available means of honest support.
Of course her education was of the most meager sort,
yet she combined a store of good sense, so often miscalled
&#8220;common,&#8221; with a character of sterling worth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Especially did she make known her abhorrence of the
traffic in intoxicating liquors, common at that time to
all hotels, or &#8220;taverns,&#8221; of the country. And, indeed,
she had good cause to know and feel the evils of strong
drink, as her father had gone by this path to the ruin
of his own soul and body, and the destruction of his
home.</p>

<p>When Margaret was wooed by Jared Slater, she
told him that she would never link her life with one
who was in any way bound with the chains of the
demon alcohol, whether as a user or dispenser to others.
Jared went away, but his love for the young woman
was true, and again he sought her and proposed that
he sell his tavern, and then they would marry and
move to the great forests of Wisconsin, where they
could begin life anew, unhampered by old surroundings.
Margaret finally consented, and they moved
west.</p>

<p>Jared spent the first year in clearing up a little
field for the plow, and in erecting the necessary farm
buildings; and by the time the baby boy came, things
about the place were taking on a comfortable, homelike
appearance. The little family were not utterly alone
in this far-away land, for the &#8220;tote-road,&#8221; over which
supplies from the distant railroad station, for the
farther away camps of the north, were hauled, ran
past their door, and their home became a stopping
place for teamsters and other travelers.</p>

<p>It was not long before Jared&#8217;s thrifty, Yankee mind
saw the opportunity for gain lying to his hand in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
opening his place as a regular tavern, and he told his
wife of his intention. But Margaret objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye know, Jared,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind the work.
I&#8217;m able for that a-plenty; but ye well know I married
ye and came here to get rid of the tavern. I will not
have the rum about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Margaret,&#8221; replied Jared, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have no
drink in the tavern; just lodging and the eating.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus it was for a time; but the old habits of life
were revived by the frequent demands of their guests
for liquor, as they would come in from the long, cold
drives, and Jared&#8217;s cupidity at length got the better of
his honesty and his faith with his wife, and he began
to keep and dispense liquor again.</p>

<p>At first he endeavored to keep his sin from the
knowledge of his wife; but greed bred carelessness and
indifference, and before the third year of their wilderness
home, Jared had his barroom open as a feature of
the roadhouse.</p>

<p>Faithfully Margaret pleaded and earnestly did she
warn her husband that &#8220;Whatsoever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap,&#8221; but he refused to be moved.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t drink it myself, ye know, an&#8217; if these fools
want to part with good money for the stuff, it&#8217;s their
affair. Some one else will let them have it if I don&#8217;t,
and I may as well have the money as any one else.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not long before the effects of the stream of
damnation that flowed out from Slater&#8217;s roadhouse
began to show themselves. When John Pollard went
home and beat his wife, so that the life of a soon-expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
little one was snuffed out, and the mother lingered
long at death&#8217;s door, it was whispered that the
blame lay in Jared Slater&#8217;s barroom. And when that
winter a tote team arrived at a camp further north
with the body of the driver stark and stiff, an empty
bottle from Jared&#8217;s shelf told the story.</p>

<p>Not only did the tavernkeeper sell his liquid hell
to white travelers, but his Indian neighbors, although
especially protected by a law of the land, became his
customers on the sly, and Jared&#8217;s eyes gloated over the
piles of rich pelts stored in the back room, that represented
to him but a paltry outlay in liquor.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll come on ye, Jared, it&#8217;ll come on ye. I&#8217;m
afeared for ye. Ye know how the drink sets the red
men wild. It&#8217;ll come back on ye, as sure as God lives,&#8221;
solemnly protested Margaret.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was one of those beautiful days in the late spring,
when all nature seemed to be trying to show man a
picture of heaven. The soft air was singing in the
pine tops, the blackbirds were holding a song chorus
nearby, and the open glade was brilliant with spring
blossoms. The babe was making happy little noises
in the sunshine, as it came through the open door.
The shadow seemed for the moment to be lifted from
the heart of Margaret, and she sang a hymn as she
went about her work. Then suddenly she instinctively
turned her eyes toward the door, with a feeling of fear.
There stood three Indians silently watching. As they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
saw the woman notice them, one spoke a single word,
&#8220;Whisk!&#8221; Margaret stood as if turned to stone. The
Indian again spoke, &#8220;Give whisk quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman saw her danger, but never would she
handle the accursed stuff. The Indians crowded into
the room, and stalking past Margaret, proceeded to
help themselves at the bar. Then Margaret turned
upon them like a fury. For their own sakes, for her
sake and the baby&#8217;s, they should not get the fiery liquor.
Bravely she struggled; then came the flash of a tomahawk,
one shrill scream, and the lifeless form of the
young mother lay upon the floor.</p>

<p>The Indians drank their fill; they drank until escape
for themselves was impossible, and they lay
sprawled upon the floor in drunken stupor.</p>

<p>At near sundown Jared Slater returned to his
home. The baby, stained in his mother&#8217;s blood, crying
upon her lifeless body, the three drunken Indians lying
upon the floor, told the whole story. The brain of the
man gave way. In the center of the road in front of
the house he quickly dug a deep hole, and into that
hole dragged the bodies of the three Indians&mdash;whether
dead or alive, no one knows.</p>

<p>That grave in the middle of the road, and the
tragic story connected with it, preached a temperance
sermon more effective, perhaps, than could have been
spoken by the faithful woman who gave her life in a
protest against the fearful traffic.</p>

<p>The boys never forgot the story and its lesson, and
it may be that its effect was felt when, in later life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
one of them put the strength of his manhood into years
of successful warfare against the liquor traffic.</p>

<p>Jared Slater lived many years, but he never sold
another drop of liquor. His crazed mind seemed to
connect both whiskey and Indians with his trouble, and
never did he see a bottle or shelf of liquor, but that
he made an attempt to destroy it; and when, as occasionally
happened, an Indian would be found in the
woods mysteriously killed, it would be whispered that
Jared Slater had been again taking his revenge.</p>

<p>God&#8217;s law is certain: &#8220;Be sure your sin will find you
out.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>ED&#8217;S ADVENTURE ON LAKE CHETECK</small></h2></div>


<p>&#8220;Listen, boys,&#8221; said Mr. Allen, one night in November,
as he looked up from a letter which a passing
tote-teamster had left at the farm. &#8220;Here is a letter
from my old friend Taylor, out in Minnesota, and he
wants me to send him a &#8216;likely boy&#8217; to work during the
winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor was a miller whose old-fashioned grist
mill, run by its large waterwheel, situated where the
Des Moines river flows out of Lake Cheteck, its source,
was flour-headquarters for the hardy pioneers of a
large section of that country.</p>

<p>Sturdy Ed begged so earnestly to be permitted to
take the place with their father&#8217;s old friend for the
winter, that, after much hesitancy, and no little planning,
the consent of Mr. and Mrs. Allen was given.</p>

<p>It was a serious journey for a boy at that time.
The country, just emerging from the awful paralysis
of the civil war, was but entering upon that era of
railroad building which was to cover the west with a
network of shining steel. As yet there were few railroads
in that state which in a short time was to take
front rank in grain raising and milling. Saint Paul
was scarcely more than a big village, and the now magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
metropolis at the falls of St. Anthony had not
yet emerged from its swaddling clothes.</p>

<p>From the town of New Ulm Ed would have a long,
cold ride by stage to the little mill out at the edge
of civilization.</p>

<p>The few years&#8217; experience he had had on the new
farm in Wisconsin, had hardened his muscles, and, as
he was not at all afraid of work, Ed soon found and
fitted into his place at the mill. It was a little lonesome
so far from home, and the work was somewhat
monotonous, but the coming of the farmers with their
loads of grain to be made into or exchanged for
flour, gave opportunity for some sociability, and their
stories of the great Indian uprisings, known to history
as the New Ulm Massacre, were of thrilling interest.</p>

<p>As the winter came on it proved to be one of unusual
severity, although there was little snow. The canal,
or &#8220;race&#8221; by which the water of the lake was fed
to the big millwheel, and from it to be tumbled foaming
into the river at the foot of the rapids, usually
maintained an even height, winter and summer, so, the
supply of power being steady, it was possible for the
millers to make preparation late in the evening, and
leave the wheels to take care of the grist until early
morning.</p>

<p>This winter, however, the ice in the river and race
froze to the depth of three feet, and the power of
the old mill was diminished to that extent. One night,
not far from midnight, in the latter part of January,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Ed found himself suddenly awake, sitting up in bed.
Something had happened. What could be the matter?
Oh, yes, he had been awakened by silence&mdash;not
a noise, but the stopping of the noise of the mill had
disturbed him. The hum of the burrs had ceased, the
old wheel was still&mdash;the mill had shut down. He
groped about and got his clothes, and hastened down-stairs
into the wheel pit. Sure enough, there stood the
old wheel at rest, for perhaps the first time in many
years. In the runway there was a small stream of
water falling, but nothing like enough to turn the
wheel with the machinery of the mill geared on. Ed
threw over the gear lever, and the released wheel
slowly began to revolve again. Then he went up-stairs
where he found Mr. Taylor, who had also been wakened
as the accustomed hum of the stones ceased, and
had come over from the house to investigate the cause.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been some stoppage at the intake,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;Either the lake has lowered, and the ice frozen
nearly to the bottom of the channel at the mouth of
the race, or there has some trash floated in. When you
have had your breakfast, take an axe and the hook
and go up and see what the trouble is.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as daylight came Ed was ready for the
trip. He buckled on a pair of skates, as the ice was
in prime condition, and taking the tools across his
shoulder, was soon skimming up the river.</p>

<p>As he came to the canal mouth, he struck with the
axe upon the ice, and it gave forth a hollow sound.
Evidently the decrease in the flow was not caused by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the water freezing to the bottom. There must be some
obstruction at the intake.</p>

<p>It was no small work to cut through thirty-six
inches of ice and locate the exact spot of the obstruction,
but before ten o&#8217;clock Ed had discovered it. Some
wood choppers, during the summer had been clearing
on an island half a mile out into the lake, and small
branches thrown into the water had, by the slow-moving
current, been carried along finally to the mouth
of the canal. One branch lodging and freezing, became
the occasion for the stoppage of others, and then
the mass had swung around and across the mouth of
the canal, almost cutting off its supply.</p>

<p>It was no job for a weakling to cut and hook out
those limbs and brush from the icy water, but finally
Ed had the satisfaction of seeing the race fill again,
and knowing that the old wheel would be at its work
of preparing the farmers&#8217; grist once more.</p>

<p>Ed had never explored the little lake, and the
stories the settlers had told him of the Indian uprising
had made him anxious to visit some of the scenes of
that tragedy so near by. From the intake, past the
island, he could see, jutting out into the lake, Massacre
Point, where was still standing the log house
in which thirteen whites had met their death at the
hands of the savages. While it would mean the loss
of his dinner, the lad thought that as he was so near,
he would skate over to that point, which appeared
to be not over a mile away, and take a closer look at the
tragic place.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>As he was passing the island, there appeared at
the edge of a clump of low box-elders the largest dog
he had ever seen. It was nearly white and not only
tall, but long in body, and gaunt. It started as if
it would come to the boy, and he whistled to it.
However, as it sprang upon the smooth ice, Ed saw
it slip and slide, and then, as it regained its footing,
slowly make its way back to the island.</p>

<p>Little had been changed about the old log house
since that fearful day when the family, with the few
neighbors who had gathered with them for protection,
had at last succumbed to the rifle and tomahawk of
the red foes. A rusty kettle was standing in the fireplace.
Rude benches were still around the table where
the victims had eaten their last meal. In one corner a
cradle, hollowed out of a log, told of a baby&#8217;s share in
that day of horror.</p>

<p>As Ed turned away full of sad thoughts and questionings,
he scarcely noticed his approach to the island
upon the return journey. As he rounded the point of
timber, there sprang upon the ice not only one big
white &#8220;dog,&#8221; but three, with lolling tongues, making
straight for him. Then he realized what these animals
were; not dogs, but the big, fierce, dreaded timber
wolves. However, Ed was not much frightened. He
rather enjoyed the thought of a race with them. There
seemed to be only enough danger to add spice to the
adventure. On his skates he could outrun them, and
he had smooth going all the way home.</p>

<p>But he had not reckoned upon the power of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
long, lank bodies, and muscular limbs, nor upon the
hunger that drove them to attack a human being in
daylight. He had not reached the edge of the lake
before he heard teeth snap like the spring of a steel
trap, and almost involuntarily he sprang to one side
while the wolves slid by upon their haunches, endeavoring
to stop. Then, with another dodge, as they turned
and again came at the lad on the ice, he passed them
and gained a considerable distance toward home. Twice
he was able to escape them through this maneuver before
they reached the channel of the river.</p>

<p>Here came new tactics on the part of the wolves.
Upon the ground they could outrun the boy, and they
sprang up the bank, speeding on ahead, and as he
came up all made a dash for him, full in the face.
In desperation Ed threw at them the heavy ice-hook,
which they attempted to dodge, but only two got away
uninjured, while the third dragged himself off with a
broken leg. &#8220;Well, you brutes,&#8221; the boy shouted, &#8220;I
have but two of you to deal with now.&#8221;</p>

<p>His respite was not to be a long one, for as he entered
a part of the river where the banks widened out
into a tiny but deep lakelet, they sprang again from
the shore in such a spurt of savage fury that in a
few moments Ed could hear the panting breath from
those blood-flecked, foamy mouths close upon his heels.</p>

<p>Ed whirled his sharp axe around as he sped forward,
and with an almost involuntary cry to God for
help, brought it behind him in a mighty swing. A dull
thud, as it left his hand, told him that it had struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
home, and he knew that another one of the horrid
pursuers would not trouble him more. But even as the
thought of rejoicing came, Ed felt the steel-trap-like
snap of the remaining wolf&#8217;s jaws close together in
one of his heavy boots&mdash;and in that same instant the
ice gave away, as the river seemed to rise up from
beneath and overwhelm both boy and beast.</p>

<p>In his anxiety to escape the wolves, Ed had not
noticed the condition of the ice they were approaching,
nor the fact that from the chunks of ice scattered about,
some settlers had been to this place earlier in the day
for blocks to store away for summer use. The intense
cold had quickly skimmed over with thin ice the place
from which the great blocks had been taken, but not
of strength sufficient to bear the heavy weight of boy
and wolf.</p>

<p>Ed had gone clear under&mdash;the water had closed
over his head&mdash;but fortunately, as they went down, the
big brute had loosened his hold upon the boy&#8217;s leg,
and fortunately also, the ice, although not strong
enough for support, was thick enough to break the
force of the speed with which they were coming, and as
he rose to the surface, Ed&#8217;s head came up in the place
from which the thick ice had been taken away.</p>

<p>The wolf was less fortunate, for the boy never saw
it again. In his kicking and struggling to come to
the surface, he may have pushed it down under the
thick ice. However, I do not think he was sorry then&mdash;or
since, for that matter.</p>

<p>But, although the wolf was gone, the boy was by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
no means out of danger. No one who has not been in a
like predicament can realize the difficulty of one who
has broken through the ice, in getting out without aid.
In fact, there are very few cases on record where such
happy terminations have ensued. The numbing cold of
the water, so quickly paralyzing the vital forces; the
weight of the heavy clothing pulling down; the lack
of any object by which one can pull himself upon the
ice, make the condition of one in such a plight most
desperate.</p>

<p>Ed can not remember of being greatly frightened;
certainly he did not fall into a panic. If he had, he
would have soon gone under. He realized that he must
keep cool&mdash;I mean in his thoughts; for he was cool
enough otherwise&mdash;and use every possible means to
extricate himself. He was facing downstream, and
nearly at the side of the place from which the thick
ice had been cut, for the speed at which he had been
going had carried him some distance upon the thin
ice. Ed knew that if he reached the thick ice on the
downstream side, the current would draw his legs
under the ice, and he could not hope to get out. He
must turn about and make his way up stream to that
edge of the hole his body had made as he had broken
in. There Ed began with his fists and elbows to break
away the thin ice so that he could reach that which
was thick and firm. The current of the river and his
heavy boots and clothing seemed determined to drag
him away and under. Again and again he was forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to pause for breath. But the numbness was creeping
over the boy. He dared not stop in his efforts.</p>

<p>At last he reached the firm ice. Oh, for some one
to reach a hand now! but he was so far away he could
hope for no help from the mill. If the ice was only
rough he might get some sort of hold upon it with his
bleeding fingers&mdash;but it was as smooth as polished
glass, and the water, that in his struggles was thrown
upon the ice, made it that much more impossible for
him to grasp a hold.</p>

<p>Something had to be done, and that at once, or the
lad&#8217;s body would soon be slowly floating beneath the
ice along with that of the wolf&mdash;perhaps never to be
found; at least not until the spring sun should unlock
the icy prison. What would Mr. Taylor think when he
should find the axe and the other wolf? What would
be the feelings of the folks in the far-away Wisconsin
home?</p>

<p>But the lad would not give up; he must try again!
He began to spring up and down in the water, throwing
himself forward each time he came up. At last,
by a supreme effort, he did not slip back into that
yawning, watery grave, but found himself balanced
over upon the ice.</p>

<p>For some seconds Ed was too much exhausted to
pull his legs entirely out of the water, but lay gasping
for breath; all in a tremble. He could not rise to his
feet, but knowing that even a short inaction now would
prove as fatal as if he were still in the water, he rolled
over and over, away from the hole, beating his arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
upon his body, until at length he was able to sit up,
then to rise to his knees, and then stagger to his feet.</p>

<p>Ed will never forget the rest of that trip home. He
struck out to skate, clumsily enough at first, and, as
the blood began to course to the extremities, it seemed
as though a thousand red-hot needles were piercing
his flesh. The bitter cold soon caused his outer clothing
to encase him like a coat of mail, in which only the
most strenuous exertions kept enough pliability to allow
him to move at all.</p>

<p>Ed did reach the mill, after a while, and, strange
to say, suffered very little ill effect from his adventure.
His bruised hands healed quickly, and frozen toes and
ears were so usual in that winter climate, as to not be
mentioned among casualties.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />

<small>THE PAINT MINE</small></h2></div>


<p>Occasionally cows seem to be like folks&mdash;that is, possessed
with the thing which, in despair of classifying,
we call &#8220;human nature.&#8221; A manifestation of this
trait appeared several times in the spring, as each patch
of tender, green grass seemed to say to the wandering
cows, &#8220;It is just a little sweeter and juicier in the
next swale, further on. Don&#8217;t stop here.&#8221; And so they
would wander, like folks, on and on, never quite satisfied
with the present good, but always expecting to
reach the goal of desire at the next place ahead.</p>

<p>This wandering propensity was a source of much
annoyance and loss of time to the boys in their busy
spring work. Often the cows would fail to reach
home until away in the night&mdash;only then impelled by
over-full udders, and a tardy remembrance of the new
calves in the barn lot.</p>

<p>But finally there came a night when no din of bawling
aroused the boys to a late milking, and morning
light revealed but a lot of half-starved calves at the
barn.</p>

<p>&#8220;This won&#8217;t do at all,&#8221; said Rob; &#8220;we&#8217;ve got to go
after those cows, even if it means the loss of a precious
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The straight trail leading to their usual feeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
grounds was easily followed, but there little trails led
about in all directions. To the west lay the deep
Iron Creek marsh, a vast morass fully a mile wide,
supposed to be impassible except in the driest seasons.
Really, it was a sluggish, scarcely-moving, shallow
river, overgrown with rushes and coarse grass, through
which water moved slowly along, down from the
great north country.</p>

<p>This had always acted as an effective barrier to the
westward-roving of the cattle, and to the north lay the
big woods, with their scanty growth of grass. Until
late in the afternoon the boys hunted off towards the
south, circling around this low-lying island, climbing
a tree on that, in hopes of discovering the bunch
resting somewhere, hidden away. Disheartened at
last, they turned their faces homeward.</p>

<p>Shortly after noon Mrs. Allen heard a great lowing
of cows, accompanied with bleating of frantic calves,
and going to the north door had seen the cows coming
in on a run, the milk trickling in little streams from
their udders&mdash;full almost to bursting. Indeed it was
now great concern those mothers were feeling for their
offspring. She wisely let down the bars, and it was
not long before the misery of over-fulness was transferred
from the cows to the calves.</p>

<p>The return of the cows presented puzzling aspects
to the boys, but there was another mystery to be solved,
which was not able to be cleared up until later.</p>

<p>&#8220;See the cows&#8217; legs!&#8221; exclaimed Rob. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
found another berry patch.&#8221; Several times during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
those June days the cattle had returned home with
shanks dyed red from crushing the long-stemmed wild
strawberries, which grew in great profusion in patches
on the higher portions of the marsh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strawberries never stained that high up,&#8221; answered
Ed, going over to the cattle. &#8220;Maybe the mosquitoes
have been at them again. See, their udders
even are all red, and the calves have rubbed it all over
their heads too.&#8221; Ed&#8217;s supposition was a reasonable
one, for not infrequently the insects had appeared in
the marshes in such swarms as to drive the cattle in
to dark shelter of the stables, even in day time, the poor
beasts coming in frantic and all bloody from the attack
of these pests. But this time the color was not
the stain of strawberries, nor that of blood drawn by
insects.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here, look at this, Rob,&#8221; called Ed as he
held up his hand all red, where he had passed it over
the belly of Old Spot. &#8220;<i>Some one has painted our
cows!</i> This is nothing else than red paint.&#8221; A quick
examination showed that the entire bunch had received
the same treatment&mdash;a thick, bright red plaster covered
all their legs and the under parts of the body.</p>

<p>Who had done such a thing, and why? The thought
of their Indian neighbors flashed into the minds of
both boys; they had paint like that with which in
some of their ceremonial dances they smeared themselves.
Had they held the cows overnight and painted
them up this way? If so, what could have been the
motive?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>Had Mr. Allen been at home he might have ventured
a shrewder guess as to the nature of the material
with which the cows had been decorated, but
he, too, would have lacked the revelation of the secret
which came to the boys a little later.</p>

<p>The corn and oats were all in and growing nicely,
and the boys had promised that before haying should
begin, they would accompany their Indian friend, Kalichigoogah,
and his people, blueberrying, over across
Iron Creek marsh, to the somewhat higher swales and
little sandy islands of the Little Yellow river, where
this luscious berry found its natural habitat.</p>

<p>This pilgrimage was an annual custom of the red
men. Here, when the low bushes, growing luxuriantly
in moist earth, were so heavily laden with great clusters,
from a little distance it appeared as if a section
of the sky had fallen upon the ground. Then the Indians
would come and camp for a couple of weeks,
while squaws and papooses&mdash;and sometimes the men,
when they felt in the mood&mdash;would pick and spread
the fruit out to dry in the hot sun, to be afterwards
stored away in linden bark baskets, for their feasting
in the lean months of snow and cold. So much of
providence had the Indian learned from the white
man.</p>

<p>Accompanying their red friends, the boys set forth
one early morning. Their guns were reluctantly left at
home, for they would have provision to last them a
week to pack one way, and some heavy loads of the
half dried berries, they hoped, on the return. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Indians shaped their course not due west, as the boys
had supposed they would, to the Iron Creek marsh, but
northwest, to where the timber belt came close down to
the deep morass. It seemed to the boys a long way
around, but it proved to be about the only way across.
The rapid, swinging, half-trot soon brought them into
a well-worn trail, leading in their desired direction.
Whether this was a deer trail, or a path worn deep by
generations of Indians passing this way, as was their
custom, in single file, the boys could not tell. Probably
men and beasts both had a part in the formation of
this easily travelled, narrow road.</p>

<p>As they reached the place where the timber came
down to the edge of the marsh they saw why the trail
had led that way. The marsh was narrow at this point,
and nearly across, at some time in the long ago, beavers
had constructed a dam, which probably for centuries
had resisted the force of flood and current, and held
back the waters in a little lake. Along this grass-grown
solid embankment the travellers passed dry-shod nearly
to the further side of the swamp, where a break had
been made, probably started by the hole-boring-crawfish.</p>

<p>Except in the highest stages of the spring flood, all
the waters of the big marsh passed through this break.
Dark and cold, and waist deep, the strong current
was soon passed through, each of our boys, as well as
the squaws, bearing upon their shoulders a big-eyed
papoose, in addition to their packs of provision. The
Indian braves carried their guns&mdash;and much dignity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>Above the dam were perhaps an hundred turf
houses, resembling miniature Indian lodges, standing
in the shallow water. &#8220;Beavers?&#8221; enquired Rob of
his red friend. &#8220;Musquash,&#8221; replied the Indian boy.
&#8220;Beaver go. Smell &#8217;um white man&mdash;no like.&#8221; Whether
muskrat or beaver, the boys determined to come that
way trapping in the fall.</p>

<p>As they reached the western side of the marsh, a
strange sight met their eyes. A long, flat bank&mdash;how
long they could not tell&mdash;lay up against the shore,
gleaming in colors of yellow, orange and red. There
were tracks where some kind of animals had come
down across to drink at the running current.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at that, boys!&#8221; shouted Rob. &#8220;Did you ever
hear such a thing? It&#8217;s a regular paint mine. There&#8217;s
where our cows came, and they plastered themselves
so well that the stuff didn&#8217;t all wash off when they
waded through this water.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rob and Ed were for turning aside at once to investigate.
&#8220;Why, there must be tons and tons of that
stuff.&#8221; &#8220;How far do you suppose it extends toward
the north?&#8221; &#8220;I wonder how deep the bed is.&#8221; &#8220;What
is the stuff, any how?&#8221; &#8220;There&#8217;s enough of it in sight
to paint the world.&#8221; &#8220;If we can get that to market
our fortune&#8217;s made.&#8221; These were some of the eager
exclamations of the boys.</p>

<p>However, the Indians seemed to be not in the least
excited, but rather were anxious to reach their camping
place, and refused to stop, pushing ahead at the
steady, rapid pace. The trail led across a wide, sandy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
ridge covered with Norway pines. Here and there
were depressions of from one to two acres in extent,
already covered with a luxuriant growth of blue-joint
grass, nearly waist high.</p>

<p>Occasionally a deer would bound away from behind
a fallen tree. The doe and her fawn were safe
from the Indian&#8217;s rifle, but the fat, grass-fed buck
had best be wary. Once the procession stopped for a
moment as a huge <i>lucivee</i>, the Canadian lynx&mdash;&#8220;Indian
devil&#8221; as it was called and dreaded by the early white
hunters of the far north&mdash;dropped down from a pine
tree into the trail in front of them. With insolent,
yellow eyes the big cat looked them over, and, seeming
to conclude that it was not worth his while to dispute
the way, moved leisurely off. The Indians, though
armed, had a wholesome respect for this animal&#8217;s fighting
qualities, who seemed to have not only the traditional
nine lives of the cat, but a big added store of invincibility
on his own account. Any one of them,
however, might have tackled the big brute, had they
been alone, but all together would let him go in peace,
if so he elected, for the sake of the women and little
ones with them.</p>

<p>In a space bare of trees or other growth, the boys
caught sight of some noble deer antlers, yet attached
to bare skulls, and about which were scattered many
white bones. Here was the scene of a woods-folk tragedy.
The brave antlers on the two bare skulls were
inextricably locked together. The picture came to
the boys as they trudged on:&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>The crisp brightness of an October morning&mdash;mating
time; the meeting of the two gallant knights of
the forest; the quick call of challenge; the fierce stamping
of slender hoofs; the rush; the shock of impact,
head to head; the great horns locked, prong in prong,
the attempt to break away for thrust and stroke with
knife-like hoof; the long day of alternate fierce struggle
for freedom and panting exhaustion. Then came
night&mdash;and the wolves, for there were to be no more
days, long-drawn-out with suffering, for these brave
warriors.</p>

<p>It is the law of the wild that none of the woods-folk
shall die of old age, neither shall very many suffer
long of wounds, but, when the strength and cunning
that nature has given, no longer protects, their flesh
shall pass to add to the strength of the stronger.</p>

<p>The days of a week passed rapidly, as the boys
gathered berries, which dried quickly on the clean, hot
sand. However, they could not rid themselves of the
thought of the great &#8220;paint mine,&#8221; as they called it,
and the desire to investigate and learn its real value,
possessed them. They already had twice as many berries,
Rob said, as the family could eat in a year. But
Ed argued that the paint mine could wait a little,
while the berries would not. Besides, he had a plan
to sell a lot of this dried fruit to the men going up into
the big woods, next fall. After talking over the matter,
they concluded to go back after the steers and light
wagon, as now they knew the trail, and bring more provision,
and something in which to pack the dried berries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Also, they would bring a barrel, which they
would fill with the paint.</p>

<p>Taking along a few quarts of the half-dried fruit
for their mother, the boys started for home about sundown,
preferring to make the trip of eight miles by the
light of the moon, rather than in the heat of the day,
for old Sol had now begun to show his strength in
the short northern summer. Of course there would be
no chance of an investigation of the paint mine, though
Ed would fill a pocket with the pasty, red stuff, to show
to mother.</p>

<p>The berries were harvested, a goodly store, and for
which they found a ready sale among the north-bound
lumbermen, the next fall, at ten cents per pound. Returning,
they spent half a day at the red bank, inspecting
the paint mine. Where the bank lay clear and free
from grass it extended for perhaps an hundred yards
up stream, where it seemed to shelve off into the water,
and there the grass and rushes were growing up
through it. The deposit in the bank was not gritty,
but smooth and slippery, like fine clay, apparently
free from soil or dirt, and ranged in color from an
orange yellow, to a deep brown. In several places
where they dug, it was a full foot in depth, though
perhaps half of that would be an average depth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just look at it, Ed,&#8221; exclaimed Rob. &#8220;How many
tons of it do you suppose there is? If it wasn&#8217;t so far
from some railroad, we could make our fortune shipping
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Rob,&#8221; replied sturdy Ed, &#8220;it&#8217;s only about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
four miles straight to the river; and we could easily
fill the five barrels that we have, and build a raft and
float them down to Necedah. I am sure we could sell
it to Mr. Blake; he always keeps the mill buildings
painted. And then, perhaps, we could raft another lot
down to Kilbourne.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Allen had arrived at home when the boys
reached there with their specimen barrel, and was
greatly interested in their account of the paint mine.
&#8220;It is a very pure specimen of ocher, boys, and some
day, when the railroads push out into this country,
will be of commercial value.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is ocher, father?&#8221; asked Rob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chemically speaking, son, it is iron peroxide. In
plain terms&mdash;iron rust.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why is some of it red and some yellow?&#8221;
questioned Ed.</p>

<p>Father laughed. &#8220;That calls for some more hard
words, words that tell <i>what</i>, but not so much <i>why</i> or
<i>how</i>. That part you will have to puzzle out when
you are in college. The red receives its color from the
sesquioxide, and the yellow from the hydrous sesquioxide
of iron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where has all that iron rust come from?&#8221;
asked Rob. &#8220;Are there any iron mines about here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Mr. Allen, &#8220;I have seen no indication
of iron in the rock of the bluffs which push up
through the surface here. Yet the water of all these
marshes seems to be more or less impregnated with
iron. And it is that fact which gives to this section<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
its peculiar value in the culture of cranberries. Somewhere
at the north&mdash;how far, who can say?&mdash;this
water of the Iron Creek marsh, you may be sure,
flows over a bed of iron ore. Who knows but that some
day you boys may be the ones to locate that iron mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Allen believed that boys, in order to become
well-developed, strong men, should be allowed a wide
range for experiment, thinking that the lessons thus
learned would be of more permanent value than those
learned in books or from mere advice. So he agreed
to the plan the boys had explained, of rafting their
five barrels of ochre down the river to Necedah.</p>

<p>Two days were spent in mining and bringing the
mineral to the bank of the stream, another day in
building the raft, and, as the river was half-bank full
with the June rise, but two more days were required
to bring them to the big sawmill town at the foot of the
great granite bluff.</p>

<p>The boys had many questions to answer, when they
had found the good-natured lumberman, but he took
the raw &#8220;paint&#8221; off their hands, and the boys with
happy hearts turned their faces homeward with five
crisp five-dollar bills in their pockets.</p>

<p>These youngsters were not to be the discoverers
of the hidden iron mine away to the north, for many
necessary duties pressed in upon them, and they found
no time to spare for so uncertain a trip, but when they
had grown to manhood, the railroads did indeed come,
and even before their coming, the mine was laid open.
As the boys were bargaining with Mr. Blake for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
sale of their ocher, they noticed in the crowd of interested
bystanders &#8220;Old John T.&#8221;, as everybody called
the great man of all that country. &#8220;His eyes were
like two sharp augers under those heavy eyebrows,&#8221;
said Rob, &#8220;as he asked questions regarding the deposit,
the lay of the land, and the direction of the flowing
water.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is a matter of history that not long after this
incident the great Gogebic iron range, which has made
Wisconsin famous as an iron producing state, was discovered
in the northern part of the state, and &#8220;Old
John T.&#8221; was one of its large owners to the day of
his death.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>TRAPPING GAME BIRDS</small></h2></div>


<p>In one of their cow-hunting expeditions, the Allen
boys went some seven or eight miles to the west, where
they came to a deep but narrow little river, running
down through a broad marsh, or wet prairie, which was
more than a mile in width. The water in the little
river was clear and quite cool. Up and down the
stream, as far as the eye could see, the marsh was
covered with luxuriant, nutritious &#8220;blue-joint&#8221; grass,
in many places growing to a height above the boys&#8217;
heads.</p>

<p>Of the purchase money received for the Wisconsin
&#8220;swamp land,&#8221; a certain portion was set aside for its
reclamation, the direction of which work was placed
in the hands of the county authorities. Mr. Allen was
a natural, as well as practical civil engineer, and his
investigation of the land convinced him of the value
of this great tract, if it might be properly drained and
dammed to take care of the annual floods coming
down from the melting snows of the north. He found
a place where, by cutting through one high sand
knoll, a ditch might be constructed all the way in the
easily-worked peat, and the waters of the little stream
be thus turned into the Yellow river.</p>

<p>Some wealthy friends were found who were willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to back Mr. Allen&#8217;s judgment, with the purchase money,
and more than ten thousand acres of this land
were secured. Mr. Allen was able himself to obtain
from the county the contract for the drainage works.</p>

<p>It was late in August before arrangements could be
completed for beginning the big ditch, which was to
turn the waters of one river into another, and give
such control over the irrigation of some thousands of
acres of level land, that it might be planted with cranberry
vines, and the water be held upon it during the
summer months, or, drained dry, to be converted into
choice farm lands, as the future should determine.</p>

<p>A camp house was built upon the pine knoll where
the deep cut would be made, and a score of men secured
who would labor as shovelers and dam builders. First,
the course of the little river was to be straightened,
by the meanderings being cut across, then a big dam
thrown across the wide expanse of marsh, back of
which the waters could be held if needful.</p>

<p>I suppose that never was there such another dam
constructed, and yet it served its purpose well, and
endured for many years. The soil of that great marsh
was not what we are accustomed to call &#8220;soil&#8221;&mdash;sand
or clay mixed with humus&mdash;but was composed of peat.
Ages of moss and other vegetable growth had fallen
and decayed into a brown mass, into which grass roots
had crept, weaving the whole into a tough, fibrous
blanket of from three to ten feet in thickness. The
line of the ditch was staked out across the marsh, and
with knives whose blades were as broad as one&#8217;s two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
hands, and three feet long, lateral lines were cut deep
into this tough peat. Then cross cuts were made the
width of the to-be ditch forming squares ten inches or
a foot each way. Then, with a many-pronged bent
fork these squares were pulled up by the men, and
there were huge &#8220;bricks&#8221; of peat, three feet long, to
be laid into the wall of the dam on the downstream
side.</p>

<p>Of course, as the water drained from the blocks of
peat, the dam would be a light affair, as to weight, but
as the shovelers following raised it to a height of five
feet, and plastered all crevices and both sides with the
soft peat from the bottom of the ditch, it formed a
very compact whole.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen figured, and so it proved, that the grass
roots would continue to grow, and in the course of a
season or two the entire dam would be able to withstand
with safety the pressure of a two or three feet
head of water.</p>

<p>Rob and Ed found the work upon the dam fascinating,
notwithstanding the necessity of wet feet, and
back-wrenching lifting of the huge peat &#8220;bricks,&#8221; but
the work at the farm prevented them from taking the
permanent part they desired. Upon one of his visits
home, it was evident that Mr. Allen was undergoing
some unusual distress or worry of mind, and as it was
the custom of the family to discuss together the problems
that would come up, Mr. Allen finally acknowledged
that the ditchers were at that time in an ugly
mood.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>&#8220;It seems to be a question of fresh meat,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;We have one or two constitutional growlers in camp,
and while they are too valuable for me to turn away,
they have the men stirred up against the salt pork and
corned beef we have. I have made several trips to
Necedah and Lisbon to try and arrange for a supply
of fresh beef, but the drouth and fire of last year seem
to have cut down the supply of beef cattle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, I have an idea,&#8221; exclaimed Ed. &#8220;Do you
suppose you could get along if you furnished a big
dinner of game three times a week?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure we could, son,&#8221; replied Mr. Allen, &#8220;but
who is the mighty Nimrod who could shoot enough
game to satisfy thirty men three times a week? and
who is the millionaire who would pay for the ammunition?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, father,&#8221; said Rob, &#8220;if you will
give Ed and Dauphin and me the contract at the same
price you would have to pay for fresh beef, I see how
we can do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>With all due seriousness and in due form Mr. Allen
drew up the contract whereby Robert Allen, Ed Allen,
and Dauphin Thompson, parties of the first part, were
to deliver, three times per week, until freezing weather,
from twenty-five to fifty pounds, according to their
pleasure, of properly dressed wild meat at the ditching
camp on the Little Yellow River. In consideration
of which delivery of meat, Mr. Allen, party of the
second part, agreed to pay to the aforesaid parties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of the first part the sum of ten cents per pound for all
such meat so delivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurray!&#8221; shouted the boys, when the document
was signed. &#8220;Now you&#8217;ll see who the millionaires
are you are talking about.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Allen laughed, but he returned to the ditching
camp with a lighter brow, for he knew that his
boys were resourceful, and it might be that they had
hit upon some plan which would give good results.</p>

<p>Upon several acres of sod plowing, buckwheat had
been sown, and had so thriven that the early September
frosts had found an abundant harvest of the queer
little three-cornered grains already matured. The
boys found it back-breaking work to cut this field with
their old-fashioned scythes, but at last it had been
finished, and then raked up into piles to be thoroughly
cured before being stacked.</p>

<p>The buckwheat harvest seemed to be taken as an invitation
to feast, by the innumerable prairie chickens
of the vicinity, with all their kinfolk. And they came.
The boys had no reason to object as long as the birds
confined themselves to gleaning the scattered grains
from the field, but when they proceeded to tear down
the raked-up piles, and the boys saw their hard work
about to be brought to naught, their ire began to arise
against the marauders.</p>

<p>Be it said to their credit, that the thought of killing
more of the prairie chickens than could be used for
food never occurred to them. But when the opportunity
presented itself of saving the ditching job with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
fresh meat, the boys eagerly fell in with Ed&#8217;s plan of
making the birds pay for their feeding.</p>

<p>So the very next morning the boys crept along the
stake-and-rider fence, until they came close to where
the birds were noisily helping themselves to the buckwheat
harvest. The birds were taken by surprise and
ten of them were left flopping on the ground as the
flock arose at the noise of the guns. The boys carefully
cleaned and picked the birds, stuffing the carcasses with
fresh grass. Again, when the flock came back to its
evening meal, the maneuver of sneaking along the
fence was repeated, as the sun was sinking in the west.
Eight birds this time fell victims to the three guns,
and were quickly prepared, for Dauphin was to make
a moonlight ride to the camp with the forty pounds
of the longed-for fresh meat.</p>

<p>If the children of Israel were greedy when the
quails came as the result of their murmurings, these
ditchers were none the less so when it became known
what Dauphin had brought, and it required all the
diplomacy the cook possessed to put the men off until
breakfast for their prairie chicken stew.</p>

<p>Dauphin would be at the camp over night, so the
following morning Rob and Ed took their guns and
began to slowly creep along the fence toward the buckwheat
field. But before they came into firing distance,
they heard a shrill &#8220;ka-r-rh!&#8221; from the top of a
tall, dead poplar standing near, and the whole flock
took wing and sailed away to safety. The birds had
posted a sentinel upon that lookout, and it was clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
that some other plan must now be hit upon if the boys
would be able to carry out their contract.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you what we can do to fool those fellows,&#8221;
said Rob, &#8220;We&#8217;ll get out before daylight, and cover
ourselves with the buckwheat straw, and be all ready
for the beggars when they come for their sunrise
breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>This they did, and chuckled as they saw the sentinel
posted in the tree top, peering this way and that
with craning neck. All unsuspicious, the big birds
settled down over the field, and began noisily to tear at
the bundles of grain, when, &#8220;bang! bang! bang!&#8221; the
three guns rang out at an agreed signal, and, all together
again, with the second barrels, as the flock took
wing.</p>

<p>That was a famous haul, for nineteen birds were
secured. As there was no way, in those days, or place
of preserving fresh meats in cold storage, the boys
waited for their next ambuscade until the following
morning, when nearly as many chickens were secured.
At the third morning, however, the prairie chickens
lit in trees and upon the rail fence, at a safe distance
from the guns; and while they protested their hunger
with many a &#8220;ka-r-rh,&#8221; they did not come down into
the field, much to the disgust of the boys.</p>

<p>When the same result obtained for the next day,
the boys saw that some new scheme must be hit upon
to save their contract. Deadfalls, &#8220;figure 4&#8217;s,&#8221; and coop
traps were suggested and discussed, but it was decided
that the big flock had grown so wise that these were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
not practicable. At last Dauphin spoke up with a
brightening face: &#8220;How many of those little steel
traps have you, boys?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About fifty, I guess,&#8221; Ed replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve a notion. Let&#8217;s get out some of them
and I&#8217;ll show you what I mean,&#8221; continued Dauph.</p>

<p>The traps were brought out, and Dauph proceeded
to demonstrate his plan. The chain of the trap would
be fastened to a block of wood, then a little hole dug
in the ground large enough to hold the trap, leaving
the &#8220;pan,&#8221; or flat trigger, nearly level with the surface.
About the trap was scattered the buckwheat straw, and
on the &#8220;pan&#8221; of the trap was heaped a little pile of
grain, temptingly ready for a bird breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we are ready for them,&#8221; said Dauph. &#8220;They
may set their old sentinels, and we&#8217;ll let them see us&mdash;at
a distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The plan worked. There would be a momentary
flutter as a bird would be caught by the neck when
the trap sprung at its pecking, or as a chicken would
vainly try to fly away with the block of wood when the
steel jaws closed upon a thickly feathered leg, but
hearing no gun, and taking note of the human foes
still at a safe distance, the foolish actions of their individual
neighbors were considered to be of no concern
to the rest of the flock. And never did they come
to the knowledge that they were being trapped. The
boys were able to harvest, each day from the traps
they set, from fifteen to twenty of the big birds from
their buckwheat field, and not only saved the day for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the big ditching job, but through their contract were
able to lay up a nice sum toward their future projects.</p>

<p>The drainage operations closed down in October,
but not before a ditch had been run for two miles
from the Yellow river to the big sand knoll. It was
through this that the more serious part of the work
would be found, and here again, in the latter part of
March, Mr. Allen brought a crew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said Ed, one day, &#8220;what are you doing
this spring for fresh meat? Of course we can&#8217;t get you
any prairie chickens, but we would like to earn a little
more money before planting time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Allen laughed. &#8220;Why, I haven&#8217;t heard any
complaint from the men as yet about their fare, but we
might take a mess of fish once in a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fish!&#8221; exclaimed Rob. &#8220;Why, you know, father,
that we have never been able to get the fish to bite
to any extent since we have lived here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, come over and look in the big ditch,&#8221; responded
Mr. Allen with a smile.</p>

<p>The boys took the hint, and when they came to the
big ditch they saw, crowding up stream along the
sandy bottom of its clear waters, multitudes of long,
slender pickerel, one of the most prized game fish of
the Wisconsin waters. &#8220;I might have thought of
that,&#8221; said naturalist Dauphin. &#8220;These fish crowd
into every little stream each spring and swim up as far
as they can, to deposit their eggs.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the three-tined spears that Uncle Sam
Thompson made for them, the boys enjoyed great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
sport in the shallow water of the big ditch, and put
away several more dollars as a result of the fish dinners
served to the ditchers.</p>

<p>Then came the days of the flight of the &#8220;passenger
pigeons,&#8221; and a new idea entered the heads of the boys.</p>

<p>To one who was not for himself privileged to see,
the tales of the great size of the flocks of these birds,
of their nesting places, of their daily flights for food,
must appear gross exaggeration. Yet I am but stating
an historical fact when I say that at times the sky
would be darkened as by a heavy thunder cloud, and
the rush of wings could be likened only to the roar of
a mighty waterfall, at the passage of the innumerable
multitudes of these birds.</p>

<p>In the section of the state concerning which I
write, there was no form of animal life in such apparent
prodigal abundance. Much has been written of
the &#8220;passenger pigeon;&#8221; the beauty of its long, blue
and bluish-white body; its rapid flight; its habits of
nesting at a remote distance from its feeding ground&mdash;and
then the mystery of the sudden and complete
extinction of this the most numerous of all birds. For
it was, that one day the woods were full of their nestlings,
the skies darkened by their flight&mdash;and then they
were not, forever.</p>

<p>The mystery of the &#8220;passenger pigeon&#8221; is indeed
like that of that prehistoric race, the builders of the
strange mounds of that region&mdash;without doubt, a great
and numerous people, spreading from the Rockies to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the Alleghanies&mdash;but who, in some long-past days were
not, leaving no answer to Why, and When, and How.</p>

<p>The clouds of these birds spread over the boys at
their fishing. &#8220;Dauph,&#8221; said Rob, &#8220;do you know where
these birds will nest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Dauphin, &#8220;over in the dead pines
in Adams county, some fifteen miles from here. Uncle
Sam says there were millions upon millions of nests
there last year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m for taking a trip over that way to see
what we can do for another fresh meat contract,&#8221; said
Ed.</p>

<p>The boys carried out their plan, and when they came
to the abandoned fields of dead pines they found the
crudely built nests of the past year in inconceivable
numbers. About three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon the
birds began to arrive from their feeding place over
in Minnesota, and the noise and apparent confusion
were indescribable. As they came crowding into their
roosting place it was not guns that the boys needed
for their capture, but simply clubs to swing, and in
almost no time they had as many of these game birds
as they could make use of at a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys, I&#8217;ve an idea. It&#8217;s clearly too far over
here for us to come for what the camp could use of the
game for one day, or even two. But if we could make
a lot of coops and take back a load of live pigeons, we
could feed them and use them as they would be needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; replied Rob, &#8220;but catching
&#8217;em alive is another thing.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>&#8220;Well, wait until I explain,&#8221; replied Ed. &#8220;Did you
notice how the birds came flying in so closely packed
together that they had no chance to get out of our
way? Well, I&#8217;ve been thinking of the four big, close-woven
hammocks mother has at home. If we would
fasten them together and stretch them up among the
trees, I believe the birds would fly against them and
get tangled up in the meshes, and we could take a lot
of them alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good scheme! Good scheme!&#8221; shouted the other
boys. &#8220;We&#8217;ll do that very thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was ten days later, however, before the boys
were able to secure the team with which to make the
trip, and then they found brooding mothers already
hovering over the stick nests, each of which contained
two white eggs.</p>

<p>The boys were disappointed, but that the birds
might be disturbed while rearing their young was
not to be thought of. &#8220;Well,&#8221; said Rob, &#8220;it means
waiting until next spring.&#8221; But the next spring the
pigeons did not return, and to this day the scientists
are discussing what became of the &#8220;passenger pigeon.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>THE MOUNDBUILDERS</small></h2></div>


<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said Ed one evening, as he came in from
a short hunting trip, &#8220;were there ever any armies encamped
here, or battles fought in this part of the
country?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, son,&#8221; replied Mr. Allen, &#8220;not that history
gives account of. There may have been some fighting
between the Indian tribes and the voyageurs who accompanied
the Jesuit Fathers as they explored this
land, in the early days of settlement of our country,
but nothing like armies or battles have been known
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I found some old fortifications, or what
looked like them, today. I had started up a deer near
the Round Slough, and found that it took to a trail
leading almost due west. About a mile from the
slough I came to what evidently had been an old bed
of the river, where sometime in the long past it had
made a big bend, up near the high sand knolls. Now
it was entirely dry, and I ran down into the old bed
and across, and clambered up the west bank. It was
there I found the earthworks. At first, where I ran
across it, I thought it was a ridge of dirt some big
flood had left upon the bank, but as I followed it along
for several rods I came to the conclusion that it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
have been the work of men. It was of uniform height
and size, and followed the curve of the river. Soon
I came to a large mound, some twelve feet across, just
where the bend in the river had come, and saw that
another embankment, like the one upon which I was
walking, stretched out from this central mound on
the other side.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was for all the world as though some army had
cast up earthworks at this bend of the river as a protection
from an enemy coming either up or down the
river.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was after that deer, so I did not wait to examine
the old fort more closely. My trail led northward from
there, and when I had gone about two miles, reaching
that big hill we have so often seen in the distance, I
had my second surprise. I was approaching the hill
from the west, as I had lost track of the deer I had
been following, and had turned for home. On that
side the hill was so nearly straight up and down
that a fellow would have a hard time in getting to the
top. I thought I might as well see the other side of
the hill; perhaps I might find a place there where I
could climb up and look over the country. Sure
enough, there was a place where I could clamber to
the top. This, the east side, was covered with timber,
oak and basswood being mixed with the pine trees.
As I looked up at the top the hill took on the funniest
appearance; something like a big squat bottle with a
rim around its mouth and a cork stuck in.</p>

<p>&#8220;I scrambled up. About two-thirds from the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
I came to the rim of the bottle&mdash;the obstruction,
whatever it was. With considerable difficulty I got
up and over. It was plainly another case of fortifying&mdash;this
time a hill instead of a river. The earth had
been scraped away to the solid sandstone rock beneath,
and brought forward into a ridge clear across the face
of the hill. A thousand soldiers would have been safe
behind that embankment on that side of the hill, from
even the missiles of a modern army.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, son,&#8221; replied Mr. Allen, &#8220;your finds are certainly
interesting. They are undoubtedly the work
of the moundbuilders. We must examine them some
day, and perhaps may find something that will tell us
of their story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, father,&#8221; asked Rob, &#8220;who were the moundbuilders?
and when did they live here? and who was it
that was after them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have asked some hard questions, my boy.
The scientists have guessed and guessed again. The
earthworks they reared are really all we know about
them. The Indians have no traditions concerning
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, father,&#8221; persisted Ed, &#8220;what became of them?
Did they kill each other off, or did they all die of some
great epidemic?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As I said, son, these are questions which can only
receive conjectures for answer. It may be that they
were the descendants of some roving tribe that came
over from Asia by the way of the Behring Strait,
after the Lord scattered the people abroad from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
plains of Shinar. They may have continued their migrations
southward before some later horde from the
Old World, and become the ancestors of the cliff-dwellers
of Arizona, or the Toltecs and Aztecs of
Mexico and Yucatan.</p>

<p>&#8220;However, it is evident that the moundbuilders
were in possession of a much less degree of civilization
than the prehistoric ancestors of the South Mexicans,
for the moundbuilders have left nothing but their
earthworks, while the ruined cities and temples of the
ancient ancestors of the Toltecs and Aztecs show a
civilization that must have rivalled that of old Egypt,
or even famous Babylon itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it about the moundbuilders you are speaking,
Mr. Allen?&#8221; enquired Dauphin Thompson, who had
just come in. &#8220;If you can spare the time some day I
would like to take you to what seems to have been a
town laid out by those old fellows. It is about four
miles south, and I suppose half way between the
Necedah and the Wisconsin rivers. I came across it
last fall when hunting our cattle that had strayed over
on that side of the river. I confess that the strangeness
of it&mdash;like some great graveyard of giants, made
me feel a little creepy, in the twilight. I did pluck up
courage, though, to ride my pony to the top of what
appeared to be the large central mound and look about.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the fading light that filtered through the trees I
could not see well nor very far, but the mounds seemed
to extend for several rods each way. They were laid
off in regular lines, north and south, and east and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
west in what seemed to be a perfect square. There
must have been fifty or perhaps more, of the mounds.
They were not all of the same size, although they may
have once been&mdash;save the mound which I had ridden
upon; that was as large as three or four of the others.
I asked my young Menominee friend, Kalichigoogah,
about them once, but he looked scared and wouldn&#8217;t
talk. All he would say was &#8216;No know, me. Big medicine.
White boy keep away.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said Mr. Allen, &#8220;the feeling our
Indians have for such objects and places. The mysterious
to them is sacred. It is their religion to worship
or give tribute and offerings to whatever they
can not understand. I have read that from the earliest
times certain tribes of Indians have used these
mounds as burial places for their own dead, so great
a reverence had they for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, in some of the accounts given by the
followers of La Salle, or Marquette, or Hennepin, I
do not recall which, it is stated that near the junction
of the Fox and Wolf rivers in this state, they came
upon several large mounds of this kind. These voyageurs,
ever greedy of the gold supposed to be hidden
away in the New World, dug into them. But instead
of the coveted treasure, they found a few simple trinkets,
and very many human bones. So they gave the
place the name of Buttes des Mort, &#8216;mounds of the
dead.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, father, isn&#8217;t there <i>anyone</i> who can tell us
about these people?&#8221; demanded Ed. &#8220;I want to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
why they made those breastworks on the bend of the
old river, and why they went up to that hill and made
a fort. Who was it that was after them? and which
side won? Were they hunters? or did they plant
crops? What kind of houses did they live in? and
what did they look like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear boy, if I could answer those questions
correctly at this moment, I would suddenly find myself
one of the famous men of the country. As I have
said, this departed race has left but little to tell of
its existence, but that little the scientists are taking,
and by comparison and deduction, may finally build
up a plausible story.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be something like the work done by a
famous naturalist who, it is said, from a single fossil
bone of an extinct fish, that had been found, constructed
its probable framework entire. Years afterwards the
whole skeleton of this rare, ancient fish was dug up,
and the professor&#8217;s guess found to be marvellously
near the truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;While there are a few indications of the moundbuilders
west of the Rockies and east of the Alleghanies,
they seem to have inhabited the Mississippi
valley, the mounds being most numerous in the states
of Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, and Ohio. Indeed,
there were so many in the vicinity of the city of St.
Louis, that place was nicknamed &#8216;Mound City.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;While their civilization seems to have far exceeded
that of our present race of Indians, there is also indication
that they lived in constant menace of some other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
more warlike people. As we go eastward toward the
Alleghanies we find the mounds grow more defensive
in their characteristics.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the finest specimens of these defensive constructions
is known as &#8216;Fort Ancient,&#8217; and is near the
Little Miami river, in Ohio. It is on the top of a steep
hill, its stiff clay walls ranging from five to twenty-five
feet in height. The wall crooks and turns and
twists about, until it is several miles in length, yet it
encloses only land enough for a common-sized farm.</p>

<p>&#8220;At Chillicothe there is the largest of this kind of
mounds, embracing 145 acres. In connection with this
old fortress there are several high mounds which may
have been used for lookout stations.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a rule, the mounds in the valleys are not of the
warlike shapes, but are laid off in squares or octagons,
like the little &#8220;town&#8221; Dauphin has told us about on
the other side of the river. These are usually called
&#8220;sacred&#8221; mounds, though it would be difficult to give
a good reason why, other than the Indians&#8217; reverence
for that which is mysterious and unexplained. Perhaps
the best known example of this class of mounds
are those at Newark, Ohio. There is an octagon of 50
acres, a square of 35 acres, and two circles, one of 29
and the other of 20 acres. They are all joined by
avenues and surrounded by ditches.</p>

<p>&#8220;The temple mounds are fewer in number than
those of the other classes, but may, in the future, prove
to yield more interest as they are compared with similar
pyramids found in Mexico and Central America.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
In this country, the best specimen of the temple
mounds is at Cahokia, Ills. It is nearly an hundred
feet high, and is more than 200 rods around the base.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps the most curious of the work of the ancient
people are the &#8216;animal&#8217; mounds, fashioned after a
crude representation of different beasts. One of these
in the southern part of this state is a very fair reproduction
of the outlines of an elephant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, father,&#8221; exclaimed Ed, &#8220;how could that be?
Where could these people have seen an elephant? Did
elephants live in America then? or did the people
come from the land of elephants?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy, that is a part of the mystery of the past
of this mysterious race. The fact is that the Grant
county mound was clearly made to represent an elephant,
and the rest we must guess at.</p>

<p>&#8220;However, the larger number of mounds that have
been examined were used for burial places, undoubtedly
first by the moundbuilders themselves, as well as
later by the Indians.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night the boys could scarcely sleep for planning
excavations in all three of the collections of
mounds near them. Mr. Allen had hinted that some
day some mound might be uncovered which would
yield the long-looked-for key that would unlock the
history of this past and forgotten people. Why might
not it be they who would be the discoverers?</p>

<p>Ed was for making the first investigation at the
hill fort. If there had been an assault upon those
works, he argued, it must have been a fierce one, and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
doubt there would be found many of the weapons of
the attacking party buried in the soft earth beneath
the steep walls. Rob contended that if the mounds
between the rivers were, indeed, the site of one of
their towns, more relics would be found there to show
what manner of people they were in their everyday
life. Especially would it be so, he argued, if they had
been suddenly driven from their homes by an enemy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember, Ed, when Captain Hunt and his
soldiers came after the Winnebagoes and they left their
camps in a hurry, they first buried many of their
household utensils in the ground. You know how they
then smoothed down the earth and built a fire over the
place, so that the ashes and coals would give the ground
an appearance of not having been disturbed. I imagine
we may find some such caches in that mound village.&#8221;</p>

<p>Necessary work interfered with the boys&#8217; plans for
several weeks, and the first flakes of late October snow
were falling when they set off upon their ten miles&#8217;
walk to the mound city.</p>

<p>After some discussion they decided to attack the
largest, central mound first, &#8220;For,&#8221; said Dauphin, &#8220;this
must have been the mound of the chief, if these mounds
were the sites of their homes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carefully they dug a hole six feet across, searching
carefully through each spadeful of dirt. In the first
two feet down there was nothing discovered; then Ed
ran across two long, flint arrow- or spear-heads. A little
further down they came upon a human skeleton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the bones of which crumbled so badly, as they were
brought out to the air, that the boys were able to save
only the top of the skull and one thigh bone intact.</p>

<p>It was only when they reached the depth of about
four feet, nearly at the level of the surrounding ground,
that their spades struck unmistakable evidences of fire&mdash;discolored
earth, small coals, ashes, and some brown
fragments, the nature of which they could not at once
determine. &#8220;We have found it, Hurray!&#8221; shouted
Rob. &#8220;They cached their goods and built their fire
over them just like our Indians did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys,&#8221; counseled Dauphin, &#8220;let&#8217;s not be too
hasty. Let&#8217;s examine every spadeful carefully as we
dig.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the finds became more numerous: A stone mortar
and pestle, such as the Indians now use for preparing
their meal from maize; a red, stone pipe,
curiously carved; several pure white arrow-heads, others
coal-black; a stone axe, grooved near the head for
its fastening to the handle; some broken earthenware
vessels, decorated with queer, spear-point designs; and
most valuable of all, a copper knife in fairly good state
of preservation.</p>

<p>Then they came to a great quantity of brown fragments,
which upon examination, proved to be charred
bone.</p>

<p>Down through the burned earth they dug in feverish
haste toward the treasure they believed to be hidden
there. But alas! although they toiled until dark,
they were forced to acknowledge to themselves that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the ground beneath the fire had never been disturbed
before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Ed, &#8220;We didn&#8217;t find the &#8216;key&#8217; to unlock
the history of these mounds, but we&#8217;ve got one of
the old fellows, with some of his dishes, his axe, his
pipe, his spears and arrows, and his wife&#8217;s grist mill.
That&#8217;s pretty good for one day.&#8221;</p>

<p>And indeed it was, although the skeleton proved,
according to the decision of the professor of science at
Carleton College, for whose inspection the boys sent
the relics, to be that of a modern Indian, who had
been buried probably not over an hundred years. He
also wrote the boys that of the various things they had
dug up, only the broken pottery could with probability
be assigned to the time of the moundbuilders. He
added, however, that the large amount of fragments
of burned bones went to confirm the theory that the
mounds of that class had been used as places in which
human bodies had been burned, either in sepulchre
or sacrificial rites.</p>

<p>Other excavations were planned by the boys, but
the strenuous duties of their pioneer life crowded in
upon them, and the trips were put off from time to
time, until it so came about that their first exploration
into the affairs of the lost race, proved to be
their last.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>COOKING IN CAMP</small></h2></div>


<p>As Robert and Ed Allen had no elder sisters, and
the health of their mother was far from robust, they
were early trained to the simple duties of the home.
Rob, especially, prided himself that &#8220;there was no
woman who could beat him in plain cooking,&#8221; and, indeed,
his bread was voted, even by Mr. Allen, to be &#8220;almost
as good as Mother&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the frosts began to increase, and November
clouds hung gray and heavy, tote teams, with their
winter supplies for the camps in the big woods, would
frequently stop at Mr. Thompson&#8217;s for the night. With
one of these outfits there was a crew of twenty men
with their cook, bound for the upper waters of the
Wisconsin river to get out a special contract of &#8220;pumpkin
pine,&#8221; a good sized tract of these forest giants
having been located during the previous summer. This
variety of pine was very white, exceedingly soft, and
grainless, and not infrequently would yield three cuts
of logs of sixteen feet each in length, entirely free from
knots. These logs would saw into planks sixteen feet
long, with a width of from three to six feet. Of course
such timber was very valuable, even in those days of
timber prodigality.</p>

<p>The Allen boys heard that the crew boss was young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Medford, whom they had met in Necedah. He was a
clean, energetic young fellow, just out of college, and,
destined to take his father&#8217;s place in the great lumbering
operations of the state, was winning his way up
in practical service. But this morning, while his greeting
was pleasant, young Medford&#8217;s face showed a considerable
anxiety to the boys. Pete Lateur, the cook,
while wholly dependable once within the big woods,
had broken faith with the boss, and had smuggled a
flask of whiskey in with his dunnage. During this,
their first night&#8217;s stop, the liquor had provoked a
brawl in which the cook emerged with a broken arm.
After the rude surgery that he was able to give, Mr.
Thompson would take him back to the town for a
month&#8217;s lay up. But there was no one else among the
crew who could take his place, and no time to send a
team back to hunt a cook in town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rob,&#8221; said Ed, &#8220;you&#8217;re always bragging about
your cooking, why don&#8217;t you take the job?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; exclaimed Medford, overhearing
what had been spoken in jest, &#8220;Can you cook, Rob?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He certainly can, Mr. Medford,&#8221; replied Ed, not
waiting for Rob to reply, &#8220;He can beat Mother baking
beans, and as for bread&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop your foolishness, Ed,&#8221; broke in Rob, blushing
red.</p>

<p>&#8220;But see here, boys, I must have a cook, and if you
will take the place, Rob, I will give you forty-five
dollars a month for four months, and your wages will
begin today.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>Rob gasped at the thought of so much money.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll see father&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen was averse to allowing her boy to spend
the winter among such rough men as the woods crews
were known to be, but Mr. Allen said it would &#8220;toughen
the fiber of the lad&#8221; and gave his consent.</p>

<p>Alas, how many parents mistakenly think that association
with evil, and even evil experiences are a
necessary part of the education of youth. Nothing can
be further from the truth. Instead of a benefit, such
association can but result in harm. If, in after life,
the youth should come into clean ways, the deep scars
of evil will remain, and he will carry with him to the
grave that which he would fain forget.</p>

<p>For the first fifty miles the crew were able to get
their meals at least twice a day at rough wayside taverns,
themselves but little better than camps, but which
afforded shelter and an abundance of food, such as it
was. Then the trail led up into the unbroken wilderness
of forest, where camps must needs be made at
night, and there Rob&#8217;s winter work began.</p>

<p>There was something solemn and majestic about the
big woods. There was little undergrowth, and the
ground was covered deep with the rich, brown carpet
of needles. The tall trunks of the great pines rose
straight to the dark canopy above, like the pillars of
some vast cathedral. The very silence was suggestive
of worship&mdash;the low moaning of the high-up tops came
to the ears as a soft, opening, minor strain from some
grand organ.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>A dead, dry pine was felled, logs sawed from it
and split, a fire built, and soon a bed of glowing coals
was ready for the great pans of frying salt pork.
Two crotched sticks were driven into the ground a
few feet apart, and a pole laid across them, upon which
the big coffee kettle was swung, and under it a good
fire was soon going. Then biscuit dough was mixed&mdash;not
with milk, but with clear, cold water from the
river&mdash;and placed in the baker. This arrangement was
something like a three-leaved book made of tin, with
folding legs for the upper and lower leaves. When
opened before the bed of glowing coals&mdash;the bread being
placed upon the middle leaf&mdash;it was a no mean substitute
for an oven.</p>

<p>Tin plates and cups, iron knives and forks and
spoons, were distributed; a jug of molasses and a bowl
of brown sugar were placed handy, and the cry of
&#8220;Chuck&#8217;s ready!&#8221; was given. Not very appetizing!&mdash;perhaps
not to you, my reader, but with these hardy
men, living out of doors, at strenuous labor, bread and
meat and strong coffee, with plenty of fats and sweets
to fortify against the bitter cold, were eagerly consumed,
especially when on the march. Later, when
in permanent camp, a greater variety of food would be
prepared.</p>

<p>Wearied though he was with the long day&#8217;s tramp,
and with his efforts to satisfy the ravenous appetites
of the score of men, Rob could not roll up in his blanket
before the fire with the rest, as they finished their
meal. In a little hollow scooped out near the log fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
were to be placed a half bushel of Irish potatoes, with
a jab of his knife through the skin of each one to let
out the steam. Over them the hot ashes were raked and
packed down tight, then a few coals, and here they
would bake slowly through the night, to be eaten in
their mealy whiteness, cold, with salt, at the hasty
noon meal the next day. The coffee kettle was replaced
by another containing great chunks of corned
beef, and from the baker came several batches of delicately
browned biscuit to be packed away in a box
for the morrow. There would be no time allowed at
the noon rest for more than the preparing of the hot
coffee.</p>

<p>It seemed to the lad that he had no more than
closed his eyes, as he finally rolled himself into his
blanket&mdash;his boots under his head for pillow&mdash;than
he found himself sitting up, panting for breath, as
though exhausted by running, and trembling all over.
Clearly he had been frightened in his sleep; but by
what? The horses, securely tied near by, were snorting
and frantically trying to break away. The men,
here and there, were rising upon elbows. Then, from
the tall pine, seemingly right over their heads, came the
scream as of a woman in such agony, despair, and
heart-breaking entreaty, that it seemed to Rob nothing
in all the world could express more hopeless misery.
With a &#8220;Sh-h, keep quiet, boys,&#8221; Mr. Medford grasped
his winchester and slipped around to quiet the horses,
peering up into the thick branches as he went. Again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
that hideous cry&mdash;and Mr. Medford fired at the place
from which the sound seemed to come.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; whispered Rob to teamster Jackson,
next him.</p>

<p>&#8220;A panther. There is no danger. Lie
still.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was the noise of something bounding from
limb to limb, high up in the pines, then all was still.</p>

<p>Exhausted, though he was, with the day&#8217;s march
and labor, Rob was so thoroughly awakened, that long
after the quieted teams were again munching their
corn, and the men were snoring, he lay, looking up at
the one far-away star peeping through the boughs, and
starting up now and then as a soft pad-pad, or sniff-sniff,
or low growl, or bark, announced the presence of
some other visiting woods-folk.</p>

<p>When at last they had reached the timber tract, a
little knoll not far back from the river, was selected
as the site for the permanent camps. These would be
three in number&mdash;the main building where the men
would sleep and eat, and one end of which would serve
as kitchen; a second for the snug stable for the teams;
and the third to be used as repair shop and storehouse.</p>

<p>All hands went to work at once putting up the
houses. It was now the second week of November, and
the fierce winter storms might be looked for at any
time. The buildings were constructed of logs, about
twelve inches in diameter, the cracks between chinked
in with moss and clay. The roof was made of split
logs, the split faces being laid together, breaking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
joints. There was always plenty of chance for ventilation.
After the roaring fires in the sheet iron stoves
should finally succeed in drying them out, these rooms
would be warm and comfortable.</p>

<p>For nearly a week, during the house-building, the
men slept in tents which opened one end toward the
big log fire. At this fire also, with its undiminished
abundance of live coals, Rob baked and boiled and
roasted. Now that there was to be no more traveling,
the supplies were overhauled, and great dishes of dried
fruit&mdash;prunes, peaches, and apples, were stewed. Later,
Mr. Medford would have a team bring in fresh beef
and pork. Pea soup, hot, and rich with pork fat, was
an almost daily ration, and then the great staple&mdash;baked
beans! Lucky for Rob, indeed, was that accomplishment
of which Ed had boasted for him. Surely
even Boston itself never knew such appetizing dish as
that Rob brought forth from the &#8220;bean hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is the way in which the delicacy was prepared:
First, a hole two feet in depth, filled with live coals;
the big pot with just the right amount of beans&mdash;(be
careful to not put in too many, or you will duplicate
Mark Twain&#8217;s experience with dried apples), molasses,
a chunk of fat pork, salt and pepper to season&mdash;then
water enough to swell the dish full when done (a few
disastrous experiments will teach you the right
amount), then the coals raked out and the pot, tightly
covered, placed in the hole; ashes packed around and
over; more live coals heaped above all&mdash;and everybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
go away and forget it for twenty-four hours&mdash;if
you can&mdash;and then!</p>

<p>Bread, potatoes, meat, coffee, some kind of dried
fruit&mdash;<i>and beans</i>&mdash;such is the usual fare of the lumber
woods.</p>

<p>With the completion of the camps, Rob found his
duties a little more complicated, but he was able to
arrange his long hours so that, while work was hard,
he had the meals on time, well-cooked, and of abundant
quantity. At four o&#8217;clock in the morning the chopping
boss would call &#8220;Cookee!&#8221; and Rob would crawl out
from his &#8220;feather bed&#8221; of pine boughs covered with
its heavy Mackinaw blanket. No time to roll over and
take the &#8220;forty winks&#8221; these mornings. Soon he would
have the pitch-pine roaring in the big sheet-iron stove
for the men; then he would cross over to the kitchen
side, where the fire in the great range would set to
steaming the big pots of food. By the time the hot
biscuits were ready, the teamsters would be in from
the stables, where they had fed, curried and harnessed
the horses, and the choppers and skidders would be
plunging through a hasty toilet. By five o&#8217;clock Rob
would cry, &#8220;All ready!&#8221; and then would come a rush,
each man crowding in where he could and more like
a pack of hungry wolves than supposedly civilized
men, the crew would fall upon the food.</p>

<p>I must make one exception&mdash;a teamster who was
early dubbed &#8220;Parson.&#8221; This man, a little past middle
age, never sat down to a meal without silently bowing
his head in thanksgiving. There was no spirit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
bravado in the act; cant seemed to be impossible to the
man. He took the ofttimes brutal gibes of the men
with a kindly smile, and went his own way. At night
when the lanterns were swung from the ridgepole, and
the men, during the hour between supper and bed,
would be playing cards, telling stories, or singing songs
of their wood and river life, Mr. Jackson would take
out a well-worn, black Testament and read, and then,
with always a kind word to Rob, and often some little
helpful act, would climb into his bunk.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, Rob had the bunks to put in order,
and the house to thoroughly sweep&mdash;for Mr. Medford&#8217;s
camps must be kept clean and tidy. Then, if the crew
happened to be working at a considerable distance, dinner
must be put on at once, for an hour before noon a
team would be sent in for it, and it must be ready,
safely packed in large, tightly covered cans. What a
job it was to get an out-of-doors dinner for twenty
hungry woodsmen! Actually, one of those men would
often eat at a meal as much as would be placed upon
the table for a half dozen in the city boarding house.</p>

<p>Dishes washed and the table set, the sponge, started
the night before, for sixteen loaves of bread (for it
would take this number daily, in addition to hot biscuits),
would be kneaded down and placed in a warm
place to rise. Then there was the woodpile to tackle,
and a big stack of dry pine and birch cut and piled up
for both cook stove and heater. If dinner was to be
eaten at the camp, there were a half-dozen pies to be
made from the dried fruit, or two great pans of pudding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
to be baked, before the sixteen loaves of bread
would demand the oven. Peeling potatoes and turnips,
and giving attention to the bean-hole outside, helped to
fill to the full every moment of the forenoon.</p>

<p>After dinner dishes were attended to, there came a
chance for two hours of sleep&mdash;and insomnia, at this
time, was not even a passing acquaintance of Rob&#8217;s. At
four o&#8217;clock preparations for supper must begin. Then
serving the meal, washing dishes again, and making
ready, as far as possible, for the morning meal, filled
the time until ten o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>It is not good for man to be alone. Explorers of
the polar regions declare that the terrors of that trackless
waste are not found in the intense cold, but that
it is the awfulness of solitude, driving men insane, that
is most dreaded.</p>

<p>A strange malady of peevishness, discontent, developing
into downright meanness, seems to creep over
a company of men shut in together for a lengthened
time. Seamen on long voyages mutiny; soldiers in
isolated barracks commit ugly acts of insubordination,
or take desperate chances to desert.</p>

<p>So it is not strange that during the long winters,
when a score of men are shut up together with little
or no reading matter, no news from the outside world&mdash;nothing
to take their thoughts away from themselves,
or break the deadly monotony of their daily lives,
that this untoward trait of human nature should show
itself. Usually, before spring comes, the ill-nature of a
crew settles upon some particular one, and from becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
at first the butt of good natured jokes, he finally
is the object of genuine persecution. Woe be to that
one if he be weak in body or in mind, or if he be a
boy.</p>

<p>It was perhaps natural that this crew, all unawakened
to and untrained in the higher sensibilities
and ideals of life, and hardened by much gross sin,
should fall upon the teamster Jackson, who was so
unfailing in his religious observances. He seemed out
of place to them; his very presence was a rebuke to
their profanity and foul stories and songs, even more
so than the sharp command of young Medford, that
occasionally brought them to silence. But to all of
the chaffing and sneers and cursing Jackson presented
a quiet, even temper, and his smile held a world
of pity. As Jackson&#8217;s kindness to Rob became noticed,
it appeared to the crew that here was a way by which
they could reach the teamster, and all the devilish annoyances
and coarse brutality of a dozen man were directed
against the boy. They began by growling about
the &#8220;weak&#8221; coffee, although, as swamper Flynn said,
&#8220;Sure, &#8217;tis as black as me hat, and &#8217;twould float me
iron wedge, entirely.&#8221; The bread was &#8220;no good,&#8221; the
meat was &#8220;tough.&#8221; Day after day, Rob, having prepared
a meal that would do credit to a high-priced
hotel, would be reduced almost to tears through mortification,
by the brutal complaints. That Jackson
stood up for the lad, and told the rude fellows that by
their grumbling they showed they had not been accustomed
to good food at home, did not help matters.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>From complaints, the persecution passed to personal
annoyances. Rob&#8217;s axe would be hidden, and he
compelled to gather dry limbs to keep the fire going;
one morning he found after the breakfast had been delayed
and the bunk house filled with smoke, that the
stovepipe had been filled with moss. At another time,
his wool socks and felt boots disappeared, and he was
compelled to go about all day in bare feet. Again,
as he crawled into his bunk late one night, worn out,
he found that the blanket and boughs had all been
saturated with water, and he slept upon the hard floor
in his overcoat.</p>

<p>At last, the ringleader in the meanness, John Dolve,
a big Swede, coming in at night and not finding supper
upon the table, although it was not yet time, declared
he would fix it so that the boss would have to
get another cook.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, boys,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;he&#8217;s too fresh. Let&#8217;s
put him in pickle.&#8221; With the help of two or three of
the others, he lifted the struggling lad and forced him
down into one of the big barrels half filled with brine,
from which the meat had been taken, and fastened on
the cover. The rough men roared with laughter over
the &#8220;good joke on the cook,&#8221; but the result might have
been altogether serious had not Mr. Jackson opportunely
arrived. With face gone white, as they explained
the situation to him, he thrust the men right
and left, and liberated the poor boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Rob,&#8221; said he, as he fitted the boy out in
some of his own warm, dry clothing, &#8220;just keep yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
quiet; that&#8217;s the best way. Mr. Medford is due to
be back from below and when he comes there will be a
change in this camp for good.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Robert had not yet found that source of inner
strength which kept the teamster undisturbed in the
midst of fiery trial. The boy had reached the limit of
human endurance. He kept his own counsel, but determined
to submit no longer to such indignities. He
would start for home that very night. That the way
lay an hundred miles through what was practically a
wilderness, mattered not. No fear of hunger nor cold,
nor death itself, should keep him in the camp one day
longer.</p>

<p>Mr. Medford, urging on his team the next day, in
order to reach camp in good season, caught sight of a
figure staggering along the tote road in the distance.
At first he took it to be an Indian, but as he drew
nearer there was something that appeared familiar
about the person. What was his surprise as he came
close, to discover that the traveler was Rob.</p>

<p>The lad was so nearly exhausted that he could
scarcely speak, yet he endeavored to resist, as Mr. Medford,
springing to him where he had sunk down in the
snow, picked him up in his arms and placed him in the
sleigh. More from what he guessed, than what he was
able to get from Rob, did he get an idea of what had
occurred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, young fellow,&#8221; said he, &#8220;we&#8217;re going back;
it&#8217;s the only thing to do. You&#8217;ve good stuff in you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
although the battle has been a severe one, and now I&#8217;ll
see about bringing up the reserves.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the first out-going tote team went the brutal
Dolve and two of his companions, and soon there came
a change in the atmosphere of the camp, and the attitude
of the men toward the cook was as friendly and
appreciative as formerly it had been unjust and cruel.</p>

<p>Rob made good in his work, and the hearty commendation
of Mr. Medford was as precious balm to
heal his wounded spirit. When the four months were
passed, and the camp broke up for the spring, the
heart of the lad glowed with pleasure as Mr. Medford,
handing him a check for two hundred dollars, said,
&#8220;The extra is because you&#8217;ve been a extra good cook.
If you&#8217;ll agree, I&#8217;ll sign you now for next winter at
sixty-five dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two hundred dollars meant much to the Allen family
that spring, for by it the mother was enabled to go
to Chicago for treatment by a famous specialist, who
said she had come just in time.</p>

<small>WINTER IN THE LUMBER WOODS</small></h2></div>


<p>When Mr. Thompson proposed, as an act of kindness,
to take the cook, Peter Lateur, back to Necedah
that he might receive proper attention for his broken
arm, he did not know that it would prove to be an
opening to a profitable winter&#8217;s contract, but so it was.</p>

<p>As he stepped into the office of the Medford Lumber
Company, &#8220;Old Man&#8221; Medford, who was in earnest
conversation with a keen-eyed, brisk-appearing
gentleman, looked up, and as his eyes fell upon Mr.
Thompson, he exclaimed, &#8220;The very thing. Here&#8217;s
the man, Mr. Norman, that can do the job.&#8221; &#8220;Mr. Norman,
this is Mr. Thompson, one of the up-river settlers.
Mr. Norman is at the head of the Construction
Company that has a contract to build the grade and
bridges of the new railroad that is coming into town
next summer,&#8221; was Mr. Medford&#8217;s form of introduction.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lay of the land is such,&#8221; went on Mr. Medford,
&#8220;that the road must cross the head of the big boom
pond, and that calls for a long trestle. I&#8217;ve been telling
him that our regular crews have all gone into the
woods, and we can&#8217;t get out the piling he wants, this
season; but he insists that he going to have that timber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
on the bank of the river to come down in the spring
drive. Now what do you think of such a man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he means to get his work done,&#8221; replied
Mr. Thompson.</p>

<p>The big man&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;I may have to pay
a little extra, of course, but I shall see that piling down
here in the boom by the time my bridge builders are
ready for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Medford&#8217;s company owned a tract of young
timber over which a fire had swept, and, while its thick
growth had worked its ruin in that the trees had been
killed, the trunks had not been destroyed, but stood
tall and straight, and, if cut before the borers got in
their destructive work, would make ideal piling timber.</p>

<p>The opportunity for securing a good price for this
otherwise useless timber, as well as his confidence in
Mr. Thompson, urged the lumberman to give bond for
him that the required number and lengths of piling
would be deposited upon the banks of the river in time
for the spring drive.</p>

<p>By offering the extra high wages, which a successful
completion of his contract would enable him to do,
Mr. Thompson picked up a crew among the settlers
along the river. Among them was Ed Allen, who,
hardy and strong for his age, was well able to fulfill
the duties of &#8220;swamper.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the contract would call but for one winter&#8217;s
work, the camp houses were not so elaborate and substantial
as those of the big woods further north, yet
they were made fairly comfortable. After the cabins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
were up, the first thing was to lay out the main logging
road from the tract of timber to the river. While the
road must be as direct as possible, it was necessary
that the route selected keep to level ground. There
could be no going up hill and down dale with the great
stack-like loads which would pass over it.</p>

<p>By the time the hollows were filled, the trees cut
away, and their stumps dug out, and even the small
brush cut, so that a clear, level track extended
all the way to the river, the foreman had selected a
number of trees of the required length and diameter,
and marked them with a &#8220;blaze&#8221; on the side.</p>

<p>Sites were chosen for the skidways upon little
knolls, where the logs would be rolled up in great piles,
to be loaded upon the sleds.</p>

<p>And the chopping began.</p>

<p>The success or failure of a lumberman in the northern
woods depended as much upon the weather conditions,
as does the success or failure of the farmer.
Long-continued and severe storms may shut in the
crew for a week of precious time. Great snows may
double the labor of swamping, skidding, and loading.
But more to be dreaded by the loggers is a winter
thaw. A mild winter, when the snow melts in the middle
of the day, is, to the logger, as a rainless summer
to the husbandman.</p>

<p>With this contract it was not a matter of how many
of the logs might be hauled to the river, but a question
whether the whole number was delivered. So every
hour would count; every advantage of the peculiarities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of the weather must be taken, both in felling the trees
and in hauling.</p>

<p>It seemed to Ed that he would barely stretch himself
in his bunk at night before he would hear the
foreman&#8217;s &#8220;All out&#8221; in the morning, and with the others
he would hasten into his mackinaws and felt boots,
his sleep-heavy eyes hardly open before their plunge
into the icy water, as the cry &#8220;Chuck&#8217;s ready&#8221; would
be heard from the cook.</p>

<p>As soon as one could &#8220;see to swing an axe&#8221; the crew
would be in the timber tract, ready for the strenuous
labor of the day. What matter if the mercury would
register zero, and the snow lay knee deep on the level?
did not their pulses bound with the rich wine of life?
was not the very air a tonic? and the hard work filled
with the joy of achievement?</p>

<p>From about the tree selected the underbrush would
be carefully cut away, for not only must there be free
room for the rythmic swing of the keen axes, but the
life of a chopper often depended upon a quick, unhindered
leap to one side, as the forest giant sprang,
swinging from its stump. The inclination of the tree
is noted, and the place selected for its fall. The sharp
bits of the axes eat a clean &#8220;scarf&#8221; straight across the
trunk. A few inches higher up, a second cut prepares
for great chips between, and a third drives the scarf
beyond the center of the tree. A shallower cut on the
opposite side of the trunk, a snap, a creaking shudder&mdash;a
quick warning is called; there is a sound of rending
branches overhead, the rush of a mighty wind, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
then a crashing roar as the great body stretches its
length upon the ground.</p>

<p>With a rapid movement the woodsman measures
with his axe helve the prostrate trunk up to the point
where length calls for certain diameter, and the sawyers,
having already squared the butt are ready to
sever the top. What limbs there are upon the body
are cut cleanly away, and the long log, or pile, is ready
for the skids.</p>

<p>In that day the &#8220;swamping&#8221; was done by ox teams.
It was the work of the swamper to see that there was
a clear pathway for the team to the fallen trunk, then,
as it came alongside, to slip the heavy logging chain
under the body, and bring it up and clasp the
hook. At the word of command&mdash;and often cruel
proddings with sharp goads accompanied, alas! by
the shocking profanity of the driver, the animals
would brace themselves into the yoke, straining
this way and that, until finally the great log
would be started from its bed in the deep snow and
dragged to its place to be rolled with others upon the
loading skids. The stacking up of these piles was work
that could often be done when hauling operations were
impossible. However, the hauling was not a less interesting
part of the work.</p>

<p>The logging sled, or &#8220;hoosier,&#8221; bears about the same
relation to the common road sled that a Missouri river
barge bears to a pleasure skiff. It is hewn from the
toughest beams of oak, and its huge runners&mdash;tracking
six feet apart&mdash;are shod with plates of iron three to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
four inches in thickness. The beams, or &#8220;bunks,&#8221; upon
which the load will rest, are often ten feet long, so
that the loads may be of that width, and as high as the
lifting power of the loading teams and the ingenuity
of the men can stack the logs&mdash;provided always sufficient
power can be attached to the load to pull it.</p>

<p>From the main road to the skids, a temporary road
is packed down in the snow, and the huge sled is
brought into position below the skids. Timbers are run
to the bunks and securely fastened, for a slip may
mean a broken rib, or possibly a life quickly crushed
out. A chain is fastened to the top log of the skid
with a rolling hitch, and the loading team on the other
side of the sled, across from the skid, slowly rolls the
great trunk from the pile onto the sled. The first
tier of logs fills the bunks; a second tier, or perhaps a
third, is rolled into place, and the load is fastened securely
with the binding chains and pole. Then the
loading team is hitched on ahead of the sled team, and
with great pulling and tugging the mammoth load is
brought to the main road. Here the head team is released,
to repeat the process of loading for the next
team, while the load continues its journey to the river.</p>

<p>So level and so smooth is the track that comparatively
little force is needed to move these immense
loads&mdash;but they must be kept in motion. There can
be no stopping to rest once the load is started, for it
is probable, in that case, the sled would remain at rest
until a second team would come along to add its
strength for another start.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>Arriving at the river, the &#8220;brow boss&#8221; measures
each log, entering the figures, in his &#8220;brow record,&#8221;
giving also the totals of the loads and name of driver.
Then each log is &#8220;end marked&#8221; and with cant hooks
rolled off into the river, or &#8220;browed,&#8221; as the operation
is called. Often the river bed is filled and piled high
from bank to bank; then a new brow is selected up or
down stream.</p>

<p>The second week of chopping, which brought the
time up to Christmas, saw the contract well under
way. While four or five nationalities were represented
in the crew, the men were of that class which came
into the wilderness to make homes&mdash;faithful, steady,
and willing to give full measure of service for their
wages. In many respects they differed widely from the
&#8220;big woods&#8221; crew, gathered, as they might be in those
days, from the very riff-raff of creation.</p>

<p>A spirit of friendly rivalry was shrewdly fostered
by the foreman, among the choppers and the teamsters,
which was not long in dividing the camp into factions
loyally supporting the claims of their respective champions.
Antoine Ravenstein&#8217;s half-Norman dapple
greys had, so far, a slight lead in the record of big
loads over Bert Clumpner&#8217;s bays, while the giant Dane,
Olaf Bergstrom, was scarcely able to keep even with
his smaller, wiry, dark-skinned rival chopper, Jim
Dacora.</p>

<p>The work was now so well under way that Mr.
Thompson suggested that the men celebrate Christmas
day in holding a holiday of sports, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
would have the cook prepare a big dinner for
the occasion. Jumping, wrestling, boxing, throwing
the hammer, and pitching horseshoes, were enjoyed
with a hearty, noisy abandon, in which these big,
strong men sought to hide the tinge of homesickness
that would creep in with the memories of the day.</p>

<p>As the fun was at its height, two men, one clad in a
sleek, brown minkskin, the other in a coal-black bearskin
overcoat, were noticed approaching the cabins.
The one with the bearskin coat, whose bristling red
hair and stubby beard proclaimed his Hibernian ancestry,
walked up to Mr. Thompson, and without other
ceremony or salutation began, &#8220;This is Calhoun, the
sheriff of this county, an&#8217; I&#8217;m Phelan. We&#8217;ve come
to see what ye mane by cuttin&#8217; the timber on my land.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply, he proceeded, &#8220;Av ye
pile yer dunnage onto yer tote teams an&#8217; lave at onct,
ye can give me yer bill o&#8217; sale to the timber ye&#8217;ve
browed, an&#8217; we&#8217;ll let it drop. Ave ye don&#8217;t, well, ye
know what we do here to timber thaves.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crew had gathered about, and a sound came
from them like a low growl of an angry beast. The
hand of the sheriff went to his hip, but Mr. Thompson&#8217;s
voice rang out clear and cold: &#8220;Stop, men! I handle
this. Now you, Larry Phelan, I&#8217;ve heard of you. You
certainly are qualified to talk about timber thieves&mdash;but
you&#8217;ve got the wrong man this time. Mr. Medford
took precaution to give me the field notes of this
tract, and I have run the lines and know exactly where
I am. Now I give you just ten minutes, you and your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
bogus sheriff, to get out of sight, or my men and I will
start a new game&mdash;and it won&#8217;t be a game of bluff.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was that in the voice of the speaker which
left no doubt that he meant what he said. And while
Phelan cursed and vowed he would &#8220;have a posse upon
them that would move them,&#8221; the two strangers turned
away to where their team was standing in the distance.</p>

<p>Mr. Thompson was not altogether easy in his mind
over the affair, although he felt sure as to his legal
right upon the tract. He knew Larry Phelan to be
the most unscrupulous timber thief in that section of
the state, and who was more than suspected of having
arrangements for his own advantage with certain officers
of the courts. But more serious were his apprehensions
of the threat of Phelan as to his &#8220;posse,&#8221; for
a more reckless and desperate band of outlaws never
served another villain than this Irishman had gathered
about him in that northern wilderness. If
Phelan considered the stake large enough, a descent
upon the camp by these ruffians was something to be
taken into consideration.</p>

<p>Shortly after the opening of the new year, the successful
completion of the winter&#8217;s work was threatened
in a way that served to put all thoughts of Larry
Phelan out of mind. It came with a &#8220;January thaw.&#8221;
Day after day the sun rose clear and bright in the
heavens, and the south wind came in spring-like mildness.
The melting snows filled the hidden hollows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
in the woods with slush and water, into which the choppers
unsuspectingly dropped, sometimes waist deep,
while the wet snow kept the clothing of the entire crew
constantly saturated.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the growing discomfort of the
situation, no let up on the work could be allowed, as
hope argued for a soon return of zero weather.</p>

<p>The pressure of the immense loads upon the main
road had made of it an almost solid bed of ice, and so
it was that with the aid of an extra team from the
skidways to the main road, the hauling operations
were not seriously interfered with at the first.</p>

<p>But the warm days continued, and the sharp calks
of the horseshoes began to tear up the surface of the
icy road. &#8220;If we could only keep the smooth ice surface
on the road, we could make it; but a few more
days of such cutting and the road is ruined,&#8221; gloomily
exclaimed Mr. Thompson, as the crew gathered for a
noon meal.</p>

<p>Ed started to speak, but being only a boy, and
fearing the railery of the men, waited until he could
talk to Mr. Thompson privately. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Mr.
Thompson, that the plan would work here, but I&#8217;ve
an idea that you might think over, and try if you
wished,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead, boy,&#8221; replied Mr. Thompson. &#8220;Any
sort of a suggestion will be welcome just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Ed, &#8220;we boys used to slide down a hill
one winter on skis, and when some warm days came
that threatened to spoil our track, we watered it at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
night, and the coating of ice held where the snow
would have melted. I thought&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boy, you&#8217;ve hit it! I suspect you&#8217;ve saved the contract,&#8221;
exclaimed Mr. Thompson.</p>

<p>That was a busy afternoon for Lars Olson, the
carpenter-blacksmith, but by nine o&#8217;clock that night a
water-tight tank had been fitted upon a sled, with a
rude attachment something like a street sprinkler,
under control of the driver.</p>

<p>While the contrivance was open to improvement
(which it later received as it took its place in the
necessary equipment for logging operations) it enabled
Mr. Thompson to give his road a coating of ice
before morning, and, with the operation repeated night
after night, to defy the sun&#8217;s destroying rays a little
longer.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to tell how, in the race for
the chopping championship, big Olaf grew careless
and had a leg crushed by the unexpected side swing
of a falling tree; how Mr. Thompson, at the risk of
failing on the contract, fixed up a comfortable bed on
a pung, and sent Ed with an illy-spared team to carry
the wounded man to his home. It would make another
story how Ed was lost upon his return trip, in the great
snow storm that marked the end of the warm spell, and
was saved from death by an old Irishman after he had
already become unconscious. We would like to tell
how, when the cold days returned, Antoine Ravenstein&#8217;s
grays beat the bays with a prodigious load, that
was talked about for years, as the record for hauling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
in those northern camps. We would like to live again
with the reader the glorious days of February, in
which the contract was completed, and in addition to
the agreed wages, each man was given a bonus of ten
dollars by Mr. Thompson. But I must leave these
stories to be told at another time.</p>

<p>The winter passed; March came with its rains, and
finally those of the crew who had elected to remain
at the camp in order to be at hand to join the &#8220;drive,&#8221;
one day were startled to hear the report as of a heavy
cannon, in the direction of the brows on the river.</p>

<p>When they reached that place they found Bally
Tarbox with his crew of brow-breakers loosening
up, with charges of dynamite, the great ice-locked dams
of logs which were filling the river bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, you lop-eared nesters!&#8221; shouted the boss at
the sight of the men from the camp. &#8220;Time for you
to be hitting the trail and grabbing a peavy. Wangan&#8217;s
above Big Bull.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d you get that woodchuck?&#8221; he called as
he caught sight of Ed. &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s one of the Allen boys,
ain&#8217;t it. Say, little sawed-off, your big Bud is comin&#8217;
down North Fork now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next morning Ed started with the others of his
crew up river to join his brother Rob on the spring
drive.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>OVER THE RAPIDS</small></h2></div>


<p>Following the river trail, and being welcomed freely
to the temporary camps of the gangs of &#8220;brow-breakers,&#8221;
at a little past noon of the second day, Ed
and his companions of the winter&#8217;s logging camp
came to the head of the drive on North Fork.</p>

<p>The heavy rains had set in, and the river, swollen
by the floods of melted snow, was already a torrent
of crashing, grinding ice cakes. As the ice went out,
the river would be filled with the booming logs, which
floated loosely, often banks full for miles, from the
disintegrating &#8220;brows&#8221; along the stream.</p>

<p>Instead of meeting his brother, as he had hoped,
Ed was informed that Rob had been sent over to the
wangan above Big Bull, where the drive on the main
stream was already in motion. The boss, looking over
the small stature of Ed, remarked, &#8220;They&#8217;re wanting
polers over there, and we don&#8217;t want any more here.
As a sacker you wouldn&#8217;t be any more account than a
muskrat, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although Ed was stockily built, he was quick with
his feet, and practice had gained him confidence upon
the floating logs, so poling would be just what he
would desire.</p>

<p>Ten miles across the country of forest and swamp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
where the land was a &#8220;saturated solution&#8221; and every
little creek aspiring to be a river, was not a pleasing
prospect for a boy, but there was no other way open.
That journey lived in Ed&#8217;s memory for years as a hideous
nightmare. Plashing in mud, tearing through
thickets of briers and underbrush, wading shallow,
icy creeks&mdash;and swimming one that was too deep to
wade&mdash;losing himself in the darkness, stumbling along
blindly, by chance&mdash;or, we had better say, by the guiding
hand of good Providence&mdash;Ed finally came to the
brink of the river, and knew by the depth of the overflow
that he had reached the stream above Big Bull
dam.</p>

<p>Again Providence guided his choice, and he turned
downstream and soon came in view of the campfires
of the drive. Too utterly exhausted to do aught else,
Ed stretched himself by a big log fire among the sleeping
men, to get what rest he might, in the short space
of the night that remained.</p>

<p>It was yet dark when the voice of the boss aroused
him, and he followed with the men to their early breakfast
of pork and beans, biscuit and syrup, and strong,
black coffee.</p>

<p>There he soon found Rob, and the meeting compensated
Ed for the hardship of the journey. Rob told
him that Bally Tarbox had arrived the night before,
and had taken charge of the drive, and he had looked
for Ed to come over and join the polers.</p>

<p>While the work of the polers was more dangerous
than that of the sackers, it was much more agreeable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and, too, the wages were three dollars a day, while
the pay of the sackers was but a dollar and a quarter
to a dollar and a half.</p>

<p>By the time a dim twilight told that another cloudy
day had begun, Rob and Ed, with their long ash poles
to balance themselves, were upon the river, riding the
logs as they floated along with the rapid current. The
water had been held back by the big dam until a great
drive of logs had gathered, and then the gates were
opened for the logs to rush through and on down the
river with the falling waters. It was the work of the
polers to see that none of the logs lodged in the mouths
of the little creeks, and to keep them moving while they
were in the river.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that some of the logs should remain
stranded upon the banks as the water receded,
and this brought in the work of the sackers. Their
implements were not long poles, such as the log riders
used, but stout staves about five feet in length. Upon
one side of each was a steel hook, and in the end a
long, sharp spike. These were called &#8220;peaveys.&#8221; Where
the stranded log was small and at some distance from
the water, a row of men would approach it upon either
side, and, picking it up bodily with their hooks, would
carry it to the river. Where the log was too large to
carry, it would be rolled over and over at a rapid rate
until it went splashing into the water.</p>

<p>It not infrequently happened that a big log would
be found in such a position that the sackers would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
obliged to wade out into the icy water waist deep before
the great trunk would float free.</p>

<p>Many a time Ed and Rob had been thankful for
their good fortune as polers when they would hear the
boss roll out a torrent of curses upon the sackers as
they hesitated upon the icy plunge on some particularly
cold morning.</p>

<p>While the sackers might count on being wet every
day, and nearly all day of every day, the polers were
by no means exempt from that source of discomfort.
Frequently, in making the jump from one log to another,
a foot would slip, or, the distance miscalculated,
a sudden bath be provided among the crashing logs.</p>

<p>Again, a moment of careless inattention would deliver
the log rider to the tender mercies of a &#8220;sweep,&#8221;
or an unsettling blow from another log. Sometimes,
when the river must needs be crossed, a log would be
selected as the ferrying raft which would prove too
light to sustain the weight of the rider, and the sackers
would howl their derision at the poler being &#8220;bucked&#8221;
into the water by his &#8220;steed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rob never forgot one such experience he had on
Easter Sunday of that year. It was just after the
gates had been lifted at Jennie Bull dam, and the
crew of an hundred and fifty men were striving with
all their might to hurry all the logs through before
the water should go down. The day had opened bleak
and dreary. A raw wind swept down the river from
the north, cutting faces like a saw, and the poor
sackers, wet to the waist, were in the depths of misery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Then, shortly after noon, the leaden skies began to
spit snow, and a little scum of ice appeared along the
edges of the stream. What an Easter Day! Rob and
Ed, to whom memories of other Resurrection Sabbaths
in the city came, with their lilies and joy and song,
could be thankful that, so far, they were on the logs,
dry, and compared with the sackers, warm.</p>

<p>The polers were stationed on the booms&mdash;long logs
fastened together&mdash;and by throwing their poles with
the sharp, steel spikes into the floating logs would pull
them along and so hasten their exit through the gate
of the dam.</p>

<p>At four o&#8217;clock it was already dark, and it would
be impossible to see clearly enough to work more than
an hour longer&mdash;but the drive must be taken through;
there could be no waiting until tomorrow. Hurry!
hurry! were the orders. Rob, in his hurry, as he threw
his weight upon a backward pull with his pick pole,
suddenly felt his hold give way, and over he went
backward into the river. Luckily, the logs were not
running thickly where he came to the surface hatless,
and that he was a strong swimmer, for a few strokes
brought him to the boom and to possession again of
his pole.</p>

<p>Oh, if he might go to the wangan camp, there
before the logheap fire to wring out his streaming,
freezing clothing and get back a little warmth into his
stiffening limbs. But no! <i>The logs must be run through
the dam</i>, and that at once. Every man was needed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and nothing short of death itself would be recognized
by the boss as an excuse for failure to stay by the job.
During the next hour Rob many times wondered if
he would not be able to give that excuse and so escape
from the misery of his position, as he labored
clumsily in his freezing clothes.</p>

<p>Day by day the cooking outfit, with the sleeping
blankets&mdash;one for each man&mdash;went down river ahead
of the drivers as far as the day&#8217;s work would probably
land them. It can be imagined that stores necessary
for nearly two hundred men, to be carried by boats,
would be of the simplest character&mdash;pork, flour, beans,
syrup, and coffee, made the basis for the daily fare,
but the five meals a day were eaten with a hearty
relish by these strenuous toilers.</p>

<p>As a rule a dry spot was selected for the camping
place, and big tents stretched for protection overhead,
but the one blanket to the man and the bare ground
for the bed, left something to be desired, even in dry
weather. When, of necessity, the camping place was
wet, and the weather freezing, the day suffering of
the men was but a prelude to the real agony of the
night. On this drive of which I write it happened that
more than once the wet clothing of the Allen boys, in
which they &#8220;slept,&#8221; was found to be frozen to the
earth in the morning.</p>

<p>Running the river was no job for a weakling&mdash;such
a one never undertook the experience the second
time, nor long for the first time. It was work that told
heavily upon the strongest of constitutions; few of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
these men lived to be old, the majority falling victims
to pneumonia or tuberculosis.</p>

<p>A little below the third of the big dams the river
cuts through a stretch of rocky country, ending in a
rather steep rapids which have a drop of something
like twenty feet. From the points of rock sticking out
at almost regular intervals, across the stream, above
the current in low water, the falls became known as
&#8220;Squaw Walk Rapids.&#8221; Just below the rapids the
river takes a sharp turn, and there, in the great, deep
whirlpool was Dead Man&#8217;s Hole&mdash;a place believed by
the rivermen to be sure to take its toll of human life
each spring.</p>

<p>No log rider was so foolhardy as to attempt the
passage over the rapids and through the whirlpool of
his own will; few indeed&mdash;none, it was said&mdash;had
made the trip in safety, having been caught in the
fierce rush of the waters above, and drawn over the
rapids on their logs.</p>

<p>The day had been clear, and, the depression of
spirit caused by the days of suffering lifting, a spirit
of roystering play and rough joking possessed the men.
The polers, selecting small logs, just large enough to
sustain their weights, were giving exhibitions of fancy
riding in mid-stream.</p>

<p>A great shout of glee from Ed Allen caused Rob
to look back up the river. There he saw, coming majestically
down toward them, a great log upon which
were seven or eight sackers, taking an unauthorized
ride. But there was something in the program of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
ride which they had not planned, for quickly, relentlessly,
they were approaching a low-hanging &#8220;sweep&#8221;&mdash;a
tree stretched out over the water. Frantically they
paddled with their peaveys, striving to throw the
course of the big log out into the stream away from
the threatening danger, but without avail. The log
struck the sweep, the momentum bending the body of
the tree sharply&mdash;when, as the log rolled slightly,
it was released, and with a lightning-like spring, as
with a mighty hand the men were brushed off, helter-skelter
into the river.</p>

<p>The whole occurrence was indescribably funny to
the onlookers, and the polers were dancing up and
down on their logs in high glee, shouting mock encouragement
to the luckless men in the water&mdash;when
a roar suddenly brought a check to their merriment.
Glancing again down stream the boys saw the logs
ahead of them begin to rise and plunge in the foaming
water, and they realized that they were nearing the
rapids.</p>

<p>Now was the time for putting forth all their
strength. Unless they should be able to bring their
logs to shore, they would be carried over into the
boiling cauldron below. How puny was their strength
matched against the grip of that mighty current. The
banks seemed to be rushing by. Here and there jagged
rocks rose above the surface as if to drag them
down. Their small logs were dancing like corks. It
was almost impossible to retain footing.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use&mdash;were&#8217;s in for it,&#8221; shouted Rob above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the roar of the water and crashing of the logs, as he
threw the sharp point of his pole into Ed&#8217;s log and
brought the two together. &#8220;Stick your pole into my log
and hold on&mdash;we&#8217;ll go together.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys never lost the picture of that awful moment
at the brink of the rapids&mdash;the sharp rocks
churning the river into milky foam; the logs leaping
and, striking, going end over end; the indescribable
roar and confusion&mdash;the coming of Death with the
demand that he be looked squarely in the face. I am
sure that both boys prayed&mdash;and then the blue sky,
and the sun overhead, the rushing river, and the
crashing logs&mdash;and themselves, ceased to exist.</p>

<p>How or by whom they were rescued from the river
below, neither of the boys ever knew. But their apparently
lifeless bodies had been carried to camp and
there, after long exertion, they had been brought back
to life and consciousness.</p>

<p>For that season, at least, Dead Man&#8217;s Hole had
been robbed of its prey.</p>

<p>After the drive had come through the lowest dam
and passed the rapids there came days so ideal that
the rivermen could not believe they were the same fellows
that so short a time ago would have almost welcomed
death, if only they might have escaped their
miseries.</p>

<p>Great, snow-white clouds lazily floated overhead in
the deep blue; the sun filtered down upon the river
in patches of golden warmth; the men, out of sight of
the boss, stretched themselves luxuriously upon big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
logs, and floated with the current. Save for the occasional
stoppage of a jam the days were, as Bally
Tarbox put it, &#8220;one continual picnic with five hot
meals a day throwed in.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were occasional days of shivering cold; days
of lowering clouds and steady rain, when river and
sky seemed to mingle, and beds of sodden earth
brought no comfort at the close of sodden days. But
each day&#8217;s run brought the drive further down into
the deeper channel and higher banks of the lower river,
where the labor was less severe, and a night of dry
lodging and a meal of home cooking could occasionally
be had from the home of some pioneer settler.</p>

<p>The days grew longer, the trees budded, and some
varieties broke forth into tender leaf. From overhead
shrill choruses of red-wing blackbirds greeted the slow-moving
procession. Woodducks and mallards and
teal, in all their courting finery, sailed along in the
clear spaces between the floating logs, quick to make a
distinction between the peaveys of the river men and
the gun of the cook. Squirrels, red and grey and
coal black, chattered and scolded as they scampered
from bough to bough. Occasional glimpses were had
of raccoons fishing for &#8220;crabs&#8221; on jutting sand bars,
and the sliding plunge of an otter might be heard as
one awakened in the night.</p>

<p>Life was coming back to revel and riot in the big
woods, and the men passing through were not untouched
by its tide.</p>

<p>While the main drive passed down the river rapidly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
it was inevitable that the slower work of the sackers
would leave many logs hung upon the banks by the
failing waters. These would be more slowly worked
to the river bed, in some cases with ox teams, and then,
a good deal of water having been stored up above the
dams to augment the later rains, a &#8220;sack drive&#8221; would
bring the stragglers down to the big boom at Necedah.</p>

<p>By the time the Allen boys reached the half-mile
stretch of straight river which marked one boundary
of their home place, there was not much need of their
services as polers longer, as the river banks were high,
and there was little work save for the jam breakers at
the head of the drive. So it was, that as the familiar
buildings came into view, they bade farewell to their
river companions and were welcomed at home.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>THE GIFT OF THE FLOOD</small></h2></div>


<p>The wages from Ed&#8217;s winter&#8217;s work at the logging
camp, together with the sixty dollars each had earned
on the drive in the spring, enabled the Allen boys to
purchase a fine span of half-blood, two-years-old Norman
colts, from &#8220;Old Man&#8221; LaDauger, a half-woodsman,
half-farmer, whose capacious cabin was a stopping
place for rivermen, and for teamsters going to
and from the lumber camps. The colts, though huge
fellows, were as gentle, if as playful, as kittens, and
Ed soon had them well broken to such tasks as were
suitable to their age and strength.</p>

<p>Several acres of the rich, level land had been cleared
of willow bushes, and the larger bunches of their roots
dug out. Now, with the sprightly yoke of young oxen
hitched in front of the colts, the boys had a breaking
team not to be despised.</p>

<p>It had been a busy summer for the lads, and the toil
was severe, but they had a goal ahead, and to them
hardship and weariness were but milestones on the
road to its realization. By the time November snows
were heralded by the &#8220;honk, honk&#8221; of wild geese, there
had been a large field of well-plowed land ready for
the mellowing frosts, and later planting of corn.</p>

<p>Uncle Henry Thompson pronounced the white oak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
leaves to be &#8220;as large as squirrel ears,&#8221; which marked
corn planting time. Now the days were hardly long
enough for the boys. From gray dawn to twilight of
evening they &#8220;dropped and covered&#8221; (modern machinery
was unknown to that time and country) until
the last hill in the last row was planted with a shout.</p>

<p>The soft showers fell, and the corn sprouted and
grew. But an occasional riverman brought word of
heavy rains up on &#8220;headwaters.&#8221; Signs of weakness
had been noticed in &#8220;Big Bull&#8221; dam, and if that should
break, &#8220;Jennie Bull&#8221; and &#8220;Grandfather,&#8221; below,
would be swept away also.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did that mean? That means a second Noah&#8217;s
flood for you fellows,&#8221; said the rivermen.</p>

<p>Steadily the rains fell, and steadily the river rose.
&#8220;She is nearly bank full,&#8221; announced Ed, coming in
from an inspection late one night. &#8220;Lucky that the
main drive has gone down, or the lumbermen would
have an all summer job hauling their logs out of these
high-water sloughs.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the night the boys were awakened by the &#8220;boom!
boom!&#8221; as of steady cannonading at a distance. &#8220;It
must be the &#8216;sack drive,&#8217;&#8221; said Rob. &#8220;It would take
big logs to make that booming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Rob, listen! That booming is on the west
side of the house. You know the river isn&#8217;t over
there.&#8221; The boys sprang from their bed, and in the
early morning light beheld a vast expanse of wildly-rushing
water all about them. Fences were gone, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
so far, the substantially framed log buildings of the
farm were intact.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the flood!&#8221; exclaimed Ed. &#8220;Big Bull dam has
given way! See those big logs sailing right across our
corn field.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed, it was a disheartening situation that daylight
brought to view. Undoubtedly their corn crop
was ruined, and Rob&#8217;s school days were removed to a
more distant, shadowy future. But another misfortune
was to be revealed. Wading out to the big pine on
the river bank, to which their flat-bottomed boat was
moored, Ed brought it to the house, and the boys paddled
out to the barn lots. There they found the cattle
safe, though knee deep in water, under the sheds. But
when they came to the sheep fold, the fences were all
gone, and not a woolly animal was in sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead!&#8221; exclaimed Rob. &#8220;Every last one of them
drowned! And we expected the coming lambs would
double our flock.&#8221; &#8220;Maybe they&#8217;re not all dead,&#8221; replied
Ed. &#8220;Sheep can swim when they have to,
though of course not far in their heavy wool. But
see! the current here sets in to Big Bend timber where
there are some patches of high ground. We may find
some of them stranded there. We&#8217;ll take the boat after
breakfast, and have a hunt for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Happily, Ed&#8217;s surmise proved to be correct. Upon
the small patches of high ground in the big bend they
found here and there a half-drowned sheep, and in two
days of exhausting toil they rescued and carried back
to life and safety eighteen of their flock of twenty-six.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>The crest of the flood past, the waters receded as
quickly as they had come, and after a few days of
bright sunshine the boys were able to learn the extent
of damage done to their crop. As soon as they came
upon the ground they saw that it could not have been
worse. Not only the growing corn, but the soil itself,
as deep as the plow had loosened it, was washed away.
Not only that, but here and there, scattered over the
field, were logs&mdash;hundreds of them&mdash;left stranded by
the receding waters.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do, Ed?&#8221; exclaimed Rob. &#8220;It will
take us all summer to get them off our land, and that
means almost a whole year lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>Practical Ed was silent a few moments and then replied,
&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Rob, maybe we can get the job of
hauling them into the river. Let&#8217;s see whose mark is on
them.&#8221; Examining the hack marks on the sides of the
logs, and the brand in the ends, Rob said, &#8220;Well, about
all of them are the <span class="large">I F</span> brand&mdash;they&#8217;re Isaac Fitts&#8217;
logs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; said Ed, &#8220;that old bear; but I believe we
can haul them back into the river cheaper for him
than he can bring a crew up here from Necedah and do
it. We&#8217;ll try him, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, the Allen boys were not the only ones
who were interesting themselves in stray logs left
ashore by the breaking of the big dams. Next morning
as they were preparing for their trip to the sawmill
town, there appeared a crew of swampers with teams,
who, without so much as &#8220;By your leave&#8221; were proceeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to haul the logs into the river. A big man with
red whiskers was directing the work, with many a
shouted oath and curse. &#8220;It&#8217;s not Fitts&#8217; crew,&#8221; said
Ed. &#8220;It&#8217;s some up-river folks. Rob, I believe they&#8217;re
rebranding those logs! They&#8217;re going to steal them
from old Fitts. It&#8217;s Larry Phelan, the timber thief
and gambler. I&#8217;m going to stop him. He has no
rights on our ground anyway. You run down after
Mr. Thompson, he&#8217;s a Justice, and I&#8217;ll go warn Larry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although Ed was but a lad, he blustered up to the
big Irishman, and demanded that he leave those logs
alone. Back and forth they parleyed. At last Larry
exclaimed, &#8220;They&#8217;re my logs, an I&#8217;ll do as I plaze wid
thim.&#8221; Then to his men who had come up to listen,
he roared, &#8220;Be aff wid ye to yer work. What are ye
doin&#8217; here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are trespassing on this land,&#8221; insisted Ed,
&#8220;and these are Isaac Fitts&#8217; logs. I can see what you
are doing&mdash;making an <span class="large">L</span> out of the <span class="large">I</span> and a <span class="large">P</span> out of the
<span class="large">F</span> and putting your own brand over his on the ends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Git out o&#8217; here, or I&#8217;ll brain ye wid this peavey!&#8221;
shouted the boss, lifting his heavy cant-hook threateningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on! Hold on!&#8221; called Mr. Thompson, coming
up with Rob. &#8220;I&#8217;m a peace officer of this township,
and I warn you that you are committing trespass on
this land. Don&#8217;t lay the weight of your finger on that
lad, or you&#8217;ll get something more than a fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Larry looked into the eyes of the old man, he
saw something that had not glowed there since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
old days at Harper&#8217;s Ferry, when Mr. Thompson had
watched his own young brothers, riddled with bullets,
floating down the river&mdash;and he quieted down.</p>

<p>But the stakes were too large&mdash;here were at least
two thousand dollars worth of logs, and nobody but the
boy had seen the changing of the brands. All that the
Justice had charged him with could be settled by a
fine, at the worst, and his lawyer could probably beat
that case with a jury.</p>

<p>&#8220;Misther Thompson, ye ould nigger-stealer, will
ye tind yer own affairs. I know what I&#8217;m doin&#8217;. Go
awn, boys.&#8221; But no more marks were changed while
Mr. Thompson stayed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, boys,&#8221; said Uncle Henry, &#8220;it&#8217;s no use for
us to get into a fight with that mob. I&#8217;m too old now,
and you are too young.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle Henry,&#8221; spoke up Rob, &#8220;How much nearer
is it to Necedah by the woods trail than by the prairie
road?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A matter of four miles,&#8221; replied Mr. Thompson;
&#8220;but there is no crossing at Little Yellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can swim it, even if the water is cold. Four
from sixteen miles leaves but twelve, and I believe I
can make it with the &#8216;long trot&#8217; in two hours. We&#8217;ve
just got to get Mr. Fitts here. Those logs that Larry
Phelan is rolling into the river are his.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, lad! I believe you can do it. The roads are
something fearful, but if old man Fitts learns that
Larry Phelan is stealing his timber, he&#8217;ll drive his
buckskins here if he has to swim &#8217;em through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
mud half way and run &#8217;em over stumps the other half.&#8221;</p>

<p>There remained yet two hours of daylight as Rob
swung into the forest trail on the long trot his Indian
friend Kalichigoogah had taught him. Little Yellow
was reached, and in spite of the numbing cold of the
water, was safely crossed, the lad swimming with one
hand, while he held the bundle of his clothes high and
dry in the other. Then on he sped in the long race of
eight more miles.</p>

<p>The sun had been down for half an hour when the
gruff old lumberman opened his door at Rob&#8217;s knock.
&#8220;Well, an&#8217; what do ye want? We don&#8217;t feed tramps
here. What! What&#8217;s that ye say! My logs&mdash;an&#8217; &#8217;tis
that blackguard gambler Larry Phelan puttin&#8217; his
brand on &#8217;em and bankin&#8217; &#8217;em!&#8221; And, to tell the truth,
the language of the old man was as explosive as had
been that of Larry himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim, put the buckskins to the light &#8216;democrat.&#8217;
But lad, you&#8217;re hungry an&#8217; tired. Come in, come in an&#8217;
have a snack. Ran it in two-thirty, did ye? An&#8217;
swam the river! Well, well! But we&#8217;ll tend to the
rascal this night.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, as the old man cooled down, the needlessness
of a night ride over the waste of ruined roads
and flood-piled debris convinced him of the wisdom of
waiting until the light of day to make the journey. By
the time the birds were fairly awake, Mr. Fitts and
Rob were well upon their way, and Rob had broached
the matter of securing the job of hauling the logs into
the river. The old man turned his keen eyes upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
boy. &#8220;An&#8217; what would ye do with all the money if ye
got the job? College! What for would a likely lad
with good sense and good arms fool away his time in
college? Humph! Well, we&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phelan and his men and teams had not been idle:
all night long they had worked, and fully two hundred
of the five hundred or more stray logs were already
piled in the river, bearing the changed marks,
ready to go down to the Necedah boom with the next
rise.</p>

<p>Old man Fitts charged the swamping outfit like an
enraged bull. &#8220;So yer at yer old tricks, are ye, Larry?
I&#8217;ve been wantin&#8217; to ketch ye for a long time. An&#8217; now
I&#8217;ve got the witnesses on ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phelan started in to bluster and curse, but evidently
the presence of Fitts was something he had not calculated
upon, nor the fact that Henry and Sam Thompson,
who now arose from where they had been in hiding,
were witnesses to the felonious changing of the log
marks.</p>

<p>Larry changed his mood. &#8220;Perhaps the men may
have made a mistake in the dark, Misther Fitts. If
they&#8217;re yer logs ye can pay us what is raysonable fer
bankin&#8217; av thim, and we&#8217;ll jist call it square.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we won&#8217;t, ye thief!&#8221; roared the old man. &#8220;Those
logs in the river are your logs now, do ye understand?
They&#8217;ve got yer mark on &#8217;em, every one, an&#8217; they&#8217;ll
be put into your chute at the boom. An&#8217; they&#8217;ve cost
ye just fifteen dollars the thousand, board measure. Do
ye understand? We&#8217;ll lump &#8217;em at twelve hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
dollars, an&#8217; ye&#8217;ll write the check fer that just now. I
can trust ye not to stop payment on that check.&#8221;</p>

<p>Counter threat and curses; calling the old man a
robber (for Fitts had made a gilt edge price on his
logs), were of no avail. Larry Phelan, at the end of
many evil deeds, faced an open prison door, and he
knew it. After all, the twelve hundred dollars would
not be all loss&mdash;and the check was written.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, boys,&#8221; said Mr. Fitts, when the men
and teams had departed, &#8220;what about the balance of
these logs?&mdash;three hundred, I should say. How would
a dollar apiece do? Yes, that&#8217;s fair. Ye can worry
them all in by fall. An&#8217; young man,&#8221; said he, turning
to Rob with a queer smile, &#8220;You can count the hauling
of the two hundred already in the river, as your share,
for that college nonsense. I tacked that much onto
that thief, Larry Phelan. I reckon college won&#8217;t utterly
ruin a lad who can run twelve miles an&#8217; swim an
icy river.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>THE TRAGEDY OF THE MOUNDS</small></h2></div>


<p>Notwithstanding the strenuous work of the summer,
the boys got together frequently to talk over
their plans for the future. Dauphin and Rob would
begin together their studies in the preparatory department
of Carlton College, while Ed would look forward
to the time when he would be older and could
join them.</p>

<p>Professor Hodge had written Dauphin that the
college would accept his Natural History collection at
a price which would enable him to finish his preparatory
course and enter college, by working a part of
his time, and the care of Science Hall was offered him
to supply that need. Rob had no friends or acquaintances
in the college town, but that fact did not dismay
him. Mr. Allen had taught his boys that difficulties
were but stepping stones up the heights of achievement,
to the one who had a clean life and steady will. Rob
had both, and, whatever the price demanded of effort
and grit, he determined to have an education.</p>

<p>Dauphin would be a naturalist. He would need the
training of the college to give him quick perception,
ability to classify his knowledge, and arrive at correct
conclusions. He would need to study the languages in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
order that what had been revealed in the research of
men of other lands might be his.</p>

<p>Rob had not yet chosen the line of his life work,
but he was equally sure with Dauph that success and
fame awaited boys who would apply themselves as they
intended to do. Many were the happy, earnest hours
spent by the boys in talking over the years they had
spent together, as well as the years that were to come.
How marvelously their lives had been spared, many
times, since they had made their home in the forest
wilderness. Through dangers of fire and drowning
and freezing, one or another of them had been snatched
back from the grave. The work of these pioneer boys
had been hard, but it had developed them into lads of
tough fiber, both of body and brain. They had had no
idle hours; whether at work out of doors, or during
the long evenings of the winters, they had their purpose
in view&mdash;to prepare for life through college. If
their few dollars earned were jealously put away for
this purpose, no less were their minds trained by study
for the necessary preparation.</p>

<p>The days of August were drawing rapidly to a
close; soon farewells must be said, and the delights of
forest and stream, as well as the duties of the farm,
be laid aside by the older boys for years, if not forever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; said Dauphin, &#8220;Professor Hodge, in one of
his letters, suggested that he would like the measurements
of the hill and river forts, and the old mound
city, for a paper he is preparing on &#8216;The Moundbuilders
in Wisconsin.&#8217; Let&#8217;s take a couple of days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and do a little more exploring, and sketch the mounds,
and take the measurements for the professor.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys readily agreed to the plan, and Ed suggested
that they go by the Indian camp at the mouth
of Little Yellow, opposite Jim Dacora&#8217;s, and persuade
their friend Kalichigoogah to accompany them over to
the mound village.</p>

<p>The young Indian welcomed the boys to the camp,
and his mother, Menominee Mary, invited them to rest
a bit in the wigwam. The earth floor was as neat and
wholesome as the floor of a parlor. Around the sides
were the couches, platforms raised about a foot from
the floor and heavily covered with the soft-dressed
and ornamented skins of bear, lynx, raccoon, and deer.
The Indian mother offered the boys sweet, ripe blackberries
in white, birchbark dishes, but when they mentioned
the object of their expedition there came over
her a quick stiffening of body, and a startled look, almost
of fear in her eyes. &#8220;Butte-des-morts&#8221; said she
using the French description, &#8220;much bad. White boys
stay here&mdash;not go.&#8221; But the boys, of course, were determined
to go on, notwithstanding the warning of the
Indian woman, which they were wholly at loss to understand.
After the return of the Winnebagoes
from the South, Mary had placed her son in a mission
school where he had learned to read, and had
acquired much of the way, and some of the habits of
thought of the white race; but there are things of one&#8217;s
early life that no subsequent training or polish will be
able to remove. Thus it was with the Indian lad&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
veneration or superstitious fear of the mysterious relics
of the moundbuilders&mdash;places of &#8220;big medicine.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was willing to explain to the boys the cause of
his mother&#8217;s warning, but was as loth as she that these
sacred places should be disturbed. &#8220;They mounds of
dead,&#8221; said Kalichigoogah. &#8220;Big men, tall like trees,
make camp there. One day come snake, long like Minnenecedah
[the Yellow river]&mdash;big men make medicine;
snake turn into long mound. One day come great
beast&mdash;two spears like logs in mouth [elephant]&mdash;big
men make medicine, great beast turn into big mound.
Not good white boys go near mounds. Angry spirit
wake up; kill boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The white boys agreeing that they would not dig
into the mounds at this time, but only take measurements,
and make a plan of the old encampment, the
Indian mother consented, though with great reluctance,
for her son to accompany the party. But first she
would put into his keeping a little buckskin sack containing
&#8220;strong medicine&#8221;&mdash;potent charms&mdash;which
might be able to protect them from the vengeance of
the spirits, should they be aroused.</p>

<p>As there was no need for them to hunt game, and
the danger from bears, or wild cats, panthers or lynx
small indeed, at that time of year, the boys had not
burdened themselves with their guns, but Kalichigoogah
wrapped his blanket about his new 16-shot winchester,
which the boys accused him of taking along to
shoot the ghosts. The Indian lad made no reply to
their chaffing, but strode off in silence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>The Yellow river was waded on a sandbar, and the
river flat, a mile or more in width, crossed. Here, the
annual overflows had cut the soft alluvial soil into
deep, wide ditches, so that the land looked like a succession
of long breastworks. The flat was heavily timbered
with oak and hickory and linden, with an occasional
gigantic pine rearing its head high above the
deciduous trees, like a sentinel of the forest. Here
the woods-folk still dwelt in comparative safety from
their most ferocious brother animal&mdash;man. It was
going to be hard for Dauph and Rob to part from this
paradise of the nature-lover.</p>

<p>Up, out of the river flats, they came upon the sandy
plain which stretched eastward to the Wisconsin river,
and then on to the shore of the old sea bed. Gnarled,
stunted pines covered the ground, in some places growing
in such profusion as to form almost impenetrable
thickets, but generally in more open growths, so that
walking was even less difficult than in the river &#8220;bottoms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Several times as they, boy-like, threshed through
one of the thickets they would start up a doe and her
half-grown fawn, and once they aroused a splendid
buck, with the season&#8217;s antlers now full grown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; said Ed, &#8220;aren&#8217;t we somewhere in the
neighborhood of the mounds?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not sure,&#8221; replied Dauph, who was taking
the lead, &#8220;I have never come upon them from this direction,
but unless I am mistaken, they lie just beyond
that thicket of scrub pine. How about it, Kali?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>But the Indian boy would make no reply. Evidently
the expedition was not at all to his liking.</p>

<p>In &#8220;Indian file&#8221; the boys entered the thicket of
dwarfed pines, the deerskin cap of Dauphin, the leader,
who was the tallest, just showing above the foliage.
They had gone perhaps twenty rods into the thicket,
when a rifle shot rang out sharp and clear, and Dauphin
sprang high into the air with a loud cry, and
fell in a crumpled heap at the feet of Kalichigoogah.
Like a flash out came the winchester from beneath the
blanket of the Indian boy, as he placed himself over
the prostrate body of his white friend, ready to
give his own life in defense, if need be.</p>

<p>For a moment Ed and Rob were paralyzed with
fear. Who had fired the shot? Were they all about
to be murdered? Then, as there was no second shot,
their courage returned, and they crashed through the
thicket to the opening on the side from which the report
seemed to come, but there was not a soul in sight:
neither was it possible, because of the bed of pine
needles strewing the ground, to discover any track.</p>

<p>Thoroughly mystified, they hastened back to their
wounded comrade. There they found Dauphin with
his head raised upon the lap of the Indian lad, conscious,
but rapidly weakening from loss of blood from
an ugly wound in his side. Rob tore off his cotton shirt
and as best he could applied a bandage to stop the
flow of blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get a doctor right away, and we&#8217;ve
got to get Dauph home,&#8221; announced Ed. &#8220;We might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
do more harm than good if we tried to carry him ourselves,
so, Kali, you had better hurry over to your camp
and have the men come on their ponies, and rig up a
litter.&#8221; The Indian lad looked up in a mute appeal to
not be sent away from his stricken friend, but as it
became clear that this was perhaps the only chance
to save Dauphin&#8217;s life, he hastened away on his errand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rob, you are the best runner; you had better get
down to Necedah as soon as you can, and get Doctor
Cook up. We can&#8217;t tell how badly Dauph is hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Who can describe the thoughts of that young lad,
left alone with his dying comrade? for the wound
proved, indeed to be unto death. Ed was not naturally
superstitious, but the unexplained shot following
the Indian&#8217;s warning could not help but have a terrifying
effect, deepening as the hours brought darkness
upon him.</p>

<p>Some of the time the wounded boy was delirious,
and imagined that the Indians were attacking them,
and in his endeavors to spring up it was all Ed could
do to restrain him. At length the Indians arrived
on their ponies, and a rude but serviceable litter was
made, upon which the red men, two at a time, carried
Dauphin to his home.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Thompson had been no strangers to
sorrow and death; their lives had known many bereavements
and years of suffering, but Ed never forgot
the agony of the hour in which he bore to them the
knowledge of the accident to their young son.</p>

<p>Before morning Rob arrived with Doctor Cook,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
from Necedah, but it was too late. The spirit of the
lad they had all so fondly loved, had passed out, and
Dauph was dead.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen at once notified the authorities and a
thorough search was made for some clue to the one who
had fired the fatal shot, but without success; and it
was not until years afterward that a man in a distant
state confessed to the facts. He said that with a companion
he had been on a hunting trip to the northern
part of the state, and shortly after having passed the
old mounds they saw a patch of gray deerskin moving
along in the top of a thicket, and supposed it to be a
part of the head of a deer and had fired. The cry of
a human being that followed had shown their horrible
mistake, and in a cowardly fear of possible consequences
they had hidden in the thicket until after dark
and then slipped away.</p>

<p>A new experience had entered the life of the Allen
boys&mdash;Death. For the first time they had looked in
the still face of one who had been near and dear, and
heard it said &#8220;He is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>What is death! Where was the boy who, just a few
hours before, had been with them so full of hope and
joy and vigor? Had he ceased to exist? Was that
dead body, so soon to turn to dust, all that was left of
their friend? Or, was the real Dauphin somewhere,
yet alive, and entering upon an existence in which all
his powers and aspirations would have full scope, unhindered
by earthly limitations?</p>

<p>Was it not really true that somewhere there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
God, who had made all this marvelous universe, and
man with the ability to discover and enjoy its secrets?
Did He make man like Himself? Would not man of
necessity have to be like Him in order to enjoy all that
He had created? What did it mean to be like God?
Were they like God? If not, how could they become
so?</p>

<p>Not the words of these questions, but that which
stood for them, filled the hearts of the boys, as
they looked upon the silent face of their lost comrade.
A new realm, a spiritual, was even then being opened
to them, and their angel was bidding their feet to
enter.</p>

<p>The plan for happy college years together for
Dauph and Rob was at an end. Alone the lad would
leave home and start forth upon his journey into the
strange, untried world. Yet not alone, for, although
the dear face of flesh was hidden from sight, he felt
that the bright, pure spirit of his comrade was still
with him to beckon him on to the heights.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>COLLEGE DAYS</small></h2></div>


<p>Had you met him as he trudged along the dusty
road on that day of early September, you would have
little suspected that you had come into the presence of
a hero; but the stuff of which heroes are made is not
carried in the way of outward observing, having its
place within. Records of the world&#8217;s great deeds give
the place of honor and fame to those who have taken
cities and subdued peoples, but the Book of books says
that a greater hero than he who conquers a city is he
who rules his own spirit.</p>

<p>That he was one of the &#8220;greater heroes&#8221; Robert
Allen was to make proof.</p>

<p>Had your curiosity prompted you to question the
lad, as you met him, he would have told you that he
was on his way to enter Carlton College: and had there
crept into your voice a note of friendliness, enthusiasm
would have kindled in his blue-gray eyes, and he would
have confided to you the great ambitions that had been
crowding in upon the fifteen years of his young life.
As he recounted the sacrifices that had been made in
his humble home, and the purpose and high courage
for the years of struggle before him, you would not
have seen the poor clothes, the awkward, uncouth manner,
but would have given heed to the strong, clean,
manly soul within.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>Robert Allen found employment at the college by
which, working half his time, he could spend the other
half with his books. That he was the victim of hard
circumstances, or that there was any sort of injustice
to him in the fact that he had to saw and carry up
wood for the wealthy boys, and do other menial labor,
never entered his thoughts. That his grand dreams
were coming true, and he was actually privileged to
study in a college, and sometime would be able to
graduate, was too wonderful and precious to allow any
other sentiment than gratitude to have place in his
heart.</p>

<p>While Rob was, for his age, a well-read boy and at
home with many of the great ones of literature, he
found it difficult at first to bring his mind to the habits
of study required by a college course. The class
room was a place of especial torture; of the twenty-six
students in his class, more than half were young
ladies, and when, after hours spent upon <i>amo, amas,
amat</i>, etc., Rob would arise to recite he would feel the
eyes of all those elegant girls fixed upon him and his
poor clothes. Then, the sheep before his shearer was
no more dumb than Rob before the Latin teacher.</p>

<p>After several trials and failures Rob sought the
kind-hearted professor and requested the privilege of
reciting privately to him in his room, telling him of
his confusion and its cause. The professor, with kindly
tact and Christly love, soon had the boy at his ease, and
drew from him the story of his aspirations and purposes.
Then, instead of granting his request, he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
&#8220;Robert, you prepare your lesson and come to the class
room as usual, and when you are called upon to recite,
look into my eyes, and remember that you are speaking
to a friend who knows and understands.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not long before the personal sympathy of
the young professor made itself felt in greater confidence,
and the boy was able to hold his place in the
class.</p>

<p>In the winter term a revival meeting was held in
the college church. Rob had never become a Christian,
though often he had wished he might be. He had been
well reared, morally, and his life knew nothing of the
grosser sins common to so many of our young men and
boys. Swearing, Sabbath-breaking, drinking, smoking,
and card-playing were evils of which he had no experimental
knowledge; but he knew that he was not a
Christian; that he had not been born of the Spirit.
While his roommate, Tom Wright, made sport of the
preacher, and would bring in his set of rough boys for
a &#8220;high time&#8221; after the services, Rob was thoughtful
and serious. One night Professor Jackson, his Latin
teacher, walked home with him from the meeting and
in an earnest, friendly way urged Rob to become a
Christian; adding the assurance that he was praying
for him.</p>

<p>Rob thanked the professor and walked up to his
room. One time, at least, Satan helped, for Tom
Wright and his fellows remained out nearly all night
upon a wild lark. Rob, his heart strangely stirred,
felt that he could not sleep, and at last flung himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
at the side of his bed crying, &#8220;O God, I want to be a
Christian. I don&#8217;t know how, but You know how to
make me one, and I&#8217;ll never leave this bedside until I
am saved.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rob prayed on in his stumbling way until it seemed
that he could do no more, when all at once there came
into his heart a beautiful stillness. He felt as light
as a feather, and as happy as a bird. He could not
stay in his room; and throwing open the door he ran
down the corridor to Professor Jackson&#8217;s room and
awoke him with the glorious tidings that his prayer
had been answered and he was saved.</p>

<p>Rob&#8217;s first real test came the following night at
bedtime. When he was ready for bed there were two
or three of Tom Wright&#8217;s gang in the room with him,
and when Rob, with the courage of a genuine hero,
knelt by the bedside and began to thank God for His
goodness, and claim His promise for future help and
guidance, the boys were, for the moment, dumbfounded.
Then they broke out into cursing and reviling.
They declared they would have no pious hypocrite
around there, even if they had to throw him down
stairs.</p>

<p>Night after night the persecution kept up, whenever
one of the others would be in the room at bedtime.
They would tie Rob to the bedpost as he prayed; they
drenched him with ice water; and, harder than all to
bear, they followed his praying with vile and hideous
blasphemy. But Rob had enlisted under the banner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of Jesus Christ, Who, when He was reviled, reviled
not again, and Who blessed when He was cursed; so
the fierce trial but deepened his real experience of
grace. He became an active worker for his Master
among his college mates, and had the joy of seeing
several converted through his efforts.</p>

<p>Serious breaches of discipline had occurred in the
dormitory some two months after Robert&#8217;s conversion,
and one Sunday night Professor Jackson was deputized
by the Faculty to stay in his room during the
church service and endeavor to get some clue to the
transgressors. After church had well begun, Tom
Wright and his crowd, who were all supposed to be at
the service, got out an old fiddle, and with some rough
characters from the town, proceeded to have a dance
in the halls, all unconscious of the presence of the professor
in the adjoining room. The &#8220;fun&#8221; became furious,
and one of the boys undertook to act the character
of &#8220;pious Bob Allen&#8221; for the amusement of the strangers,
the others using the name of Robert as if he were
really present.</p>

<p>As the other students began to return from the
service, the uproar subsided, and when Rob reached
his room his roommate was already there, apparently
having just returned from church. The next day, with
a very grave face, Professor Jackson called Rob into
his room. Rob went in smilingly, but his smile faded
quickly at the stern look of his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where were you last night, Robert? I want to
give you a chance to confess.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>&#8220;Why, I was at church. Where should I have
been?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to tell me that you know nothing of
the disgraceful occurance last night in the hall?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What occurance, sir? Indeed, I know nothing. I
was at church.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert, Robert, I am so disappointed in you! I
believed you to be a manly young man, and a Christian.
How could you so forget yourself as to engage in such
an affair, and then pretend that you were at church!
I was here in my room throughout, and heard your
name called again and again. Because of your previous
perfect record, no public punishment will be given
you by the Faculty, but the other boys will be severely
dealt with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Professor, I have told you the truth. Goodbye,&#8221;
and Robert staggered out to his own room, unable to
fathom the depth of his misery. His poverty and his
life of toil isolated him from the most of the students.
How he longed for the quick understanding and sympathy
of his lost friend Dauphin. He had made comparatively
few acquaintances in college, and there had
been but one, the young Latin professor, whom his
heart had really claimed for a friend. And now that
one was lost! That one despised him for a breaker of
rules, and a liar. O it was too much! The tempter
came, as he always does in the moment of our stress,
and said, &#8220;Give it up. Give it all up. It&#8217;s no use. Go
back home.&#8221;</p>

<p>The battle was fierce, and not soon over. But victory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
came&mdash;came through the stretched-out Hand that
had brought him salvation. In the darkness of his
extremity, the thought came to him that there was One
who knew all, and, he knelt and poured out his soul
to the comforting Christ.</p>

<p>Not for a moment afterward did Rob relax his conscientious
work either in the class room or in such
Christian duties as came his way. His manner became
graver, if possible, and a little shyer, but there
glowed upon the face of the lad a steady light that
would often cause a wondering look from those who
passed him by. He had conquered his own spirit,
and trusting, he looked to God for his vindication and
his reward.</p>

<p>Just before the commencement in June, an escapade
of unusual viciousness caused the expulsion of Tom
Wright and two of his fellows.</p>

<p>As the students gathered in the college chapel on
the last day of school to hear the awards of prizes
and scholarships that had been won during the year,
and the white-haired president had come to the Ira
Morton prize of $50 for the best Latin grades for the
year, he paused, and wiping his spectacles, said, &#8220;In
connection with the award of this prize, the Faculty
have delegated to me another pleasant duty. The confessions
of some students whom we were obliged to send
home, during the past term, opened our eyes to the fact
that we have had in our midst as true a hero as any
knight of old; a lad whose courage and faithfulness
under severe trial and severer suspicion and accusation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
has shown a quality of manhood and Christian
spirit that honors this institution.&#8221; Briefly the president
sketched the career of the boy, then added, &#8220;To the
$50 Morton prize, the Faculty have added another $50
in recognition of the conflict and glorious victory of
this young man. Mr. Robert Allen, come forward and
receive the honor which is your due.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the years that were to come Robert Allen was to
rise high in the world, and receive honor from his
fellow men, but no honor nor applause ever was able
to gladden his heart as did this vindication and victory
he had won through Jesus Christ.</p>
